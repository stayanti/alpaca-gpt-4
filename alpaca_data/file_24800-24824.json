Machine learning involves creating an algorithm that can learn from examples to find a solution, while artificial intelligence also considers the decision-making logic behind the solution. For example, machine learning might be used to detect a certain item in an image while artificial intelligence will also factor in the context and meaning behind the image to offer a decision-making process. Artificial intelligence is able to recognize more complex patterns and variable data, while machine learning does not need to consider context, but focuses on the specific task at hand."},{"instruction":"Change the color of the \"word\" red to blue.","input":"word","output":"blue"},{"instruction":"Calculate 0 to the power of 0.","input":"","output":"1"},{"instruction":"Outline the benefits of using a web-based application.","input":"","output":"Using a web-based application can offer several benefits.
