Then, identify any branches that are crossing or rubbing against one another and prune those as well. For branches that are growing inward, downward, or outward, prune back to just outside the bud, at a 45-degree angle. Then, remove any branches that are too close to the center to allow for better air circulation and more light. Finally, shape the bush by cutting away branches that are longer than the desired shape."},{"instruction":"Identify where a given item is located.","input":"Location: The Louvre\nItem: The Mona Lisa","output":"The Mona Lisa is located in the Salle des États section of the Louvre Museum in Paris, France."},{"instruction":"Convert the given amount in a different unit.","input":"Amount: 324 milliliters\nUnit: Cups","output":"324 milliliters is equal to 1.35 cups."},{"instruction":"Find the website of a company.","input":"Nike","output":"The official website for Nike is www.nike.com."},{"instruction":"How many paragraphs should a blog post typically have?","input":"","output":"A typical blog post should have between three and five paragraphs.

Disk backups use hard drives to store information, while tapes use magnetic tape reels. Disk backups represent a more modern storage medium, as they are quicker and more efficient than tape storage. Tapes can backup more information than a disk and are more cost effective, but require a longer backup and recovery process. Disks are best suited for short-term backups, whereas tapes are ideal for long term storage. Tapes offer less access time to restore data compared to disks; however, disks can encounter data corruption more often than tape backups. Additionally, tape backups offer better data protection compared to disks, due to their physical durability and reliability."},{"instruction":"Design an interface that allows users to order sandwiches from a deli.","input":"","output":"The interface for ordering sandwiches from a deli should be intuitive, easy to use and should provide visual cues to guide users throughout the process. The main page should list all sandwich options and include appropriate images to give users an idea of what they are ordering. A selection bar should be provided that allows users to customize the size, toppings and condiments on their sandwiches. The user should be able to track the progress of the order, and when the sandwich is ready for pickup, a confirmation page should be displayed with order details and a notification. Payment options should also be provided that include the option to pay cash or with a credit card.

Underneath the headers, the user should be able to document the date, category of the expense, sub-category (if applicable), a brief description of the expense, the amount of the expense and a running total for the month. Once the spreadsheet is populated with the user’s expenses, a graph should be automatically generated to visually represent the expenses, the categories, and the net amount paid for the month. This will help the user track spending habits and identify areas for potential savings."},{"instruction":"Design an algorithm for searching for duplicate contact entries in a list of emails.","input":"","output":"The algorithm should first read each email address to determine if the address is unique or a duplicate of an existing address. To ensure accuracy, the data should be broken down into tokens based on the local-part (before the @) and the domain-part (after the @). Then, these tokens can be compared to other email addresses in the list to identify duplicates. To handle the possibility of typos, a fuzzy matching algorithm can be implemented that accounts for errors in the input. For example, if two entries have matching local-part tokens but different domain-part tokens, a fuzzy matching algorithm can be used to decide whether it should be categorized as a duplicate or a typo. Additionally, a binary search tree could be used to compare the tokenized data and determine faster whether an email address is a duplicate or not."},{"instruction":"Create a tag cloud from the following sentence.","input":"Artificial intelligence is becoming an increasingly important part of our daily lives.","output":"Artificial | Intelligence | Important | Daily | Lives | Increasingly | Becoming | Part | Our"},{"instruction":"Categorize the following words according to their parts of speech:\n\nstrenuous, allocate, eclipse","input":"","output":"strenuous - adjective\nallocate - verb\neclipse - verb"},{"instruction":"Generate a short story about two friends who decide to go on an adventure.","input":"","output":"Jake and Andrea were two close friends who shared a passion for adventure.

It was beautiful - ancient ruins and temples made from marble, mysterious writing on the walls. \n\nAfter exploring this hidden world for a while, they encountered an old man who claimed to be the leader of the underground city. He told them that this place had existed for centuries, and only few people knew about it. He also shared stories about the legends and history of the place, and even offered to provide them with shelter for the night.\n\nJake and Andrea were amazed by what they had discovered, and as they reflected on their journey, they realized how much they had learned.
