As population size increases, the additional population growth rate increases due to the availability of resources. This is captured in an exponential curve, which shows a steeper rate of growth as the population size increases. Additionally, the rate of growth can be adjusted in an exponential model to better fit a population's growth. This allows for more accurate predictions of population growth and how it will vary in the future."},{"instruction":"Generate a 12-point outline for the topic \"Effective Communication\".","input":"","output":"I.
