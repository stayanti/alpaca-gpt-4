Making decisions involves more than just rational thought and logic, it also involves emotion. In fact, emotion has been found to play a crucial role in decision-making. Emotions are a powerful force that can both help and hinder the decision-making process. On one hand, emotions can influence an individual's thought process and can help them make decisions that would not have been possible without them. For example, emotions such as compassion or empathy can lead to decisions that are more beneficial to society, as opposed to decisions made without such emotions. On the other hand, emotions can also lead to decisions that are not in the best interest of an individual or society, such as decisions motivated by fear or anger. It is important, therefore, to use emotions judiciously and consider both the positive and negative effects of emotions when making decisions. By understanding the role of emotion in decision-making, an individual can make decisions that are more informed and wise."}]
