[{"instruction":"Given an article on the topic, evaluate its bias.","input":"President Biden on Wednesday revoked a Trump-era executive order that sought to ban the popular apps TikTok and WeChat and replaced it with one that calls for a broader review of a number of foreign-controlled applications that could pose a security risk to Americans and their data.\r\n\r\nThe Trump order had not been carried out “in the soundest fashion,” Biden administration officials said in a call with reporters, adding that the new directive would establish “clear intelligible criteria” to evaluate national security risks posed by software applications connected to foreign governments, particularly China.\r\n\r\nMr. Biden’s order reflects a growing urgency among American officials, both Republican and Democrat, to aggressively counter what they see as a growing threat posed by China’s military and technology sectors. In a rare show of bipartisanship, U.S. lawmakers have also sought to reduce America’s dependence on China for supply chain technology like semiconductors, rare minerals and other equipment. On Tuesday, the Senate approved a $250 billion spending package to bolster American technology research and development.\r\n\r\nThe order is the first significant step Mr. Biden has taken to approach the saga between TikTok and the Trump administration, which tried to ban the app over national security concerns but was immediately challenged in federal court.\r\n\r\nAnalysts said the new executive order was meant to create a process that could withstand such a challenge if the Biden administration chose to ratchet up pressure on individual apps.\r\n\r\n“It’s a bit of a troll to the Trump administration approach,” said Brian J. Fleming, a lawyer who focuses on national security and international trade matters, “which was exposed in court as being a bit of a hollow process that was completely outcome driven.”","output":"The article appears to have a bias against the Trump administration's handling of the TikTok and WeChat issue. The article implies that the Trump administration's previous executive order was not carried out soundly and was outcome-driven. The article further highlights that the new executive order by President Biden establishes clear and intelligible criteria to evaluate national security risks posed by software applications connected to foreign governments, particularly China.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the article suggests that the Biden administration's approach is a significant step towards addressing the issue between TikTok and the Trump administration. The article frames this issue as a saga and implies that the previous administration's approach was not successful."},{"instruction":"Suggest a healthy snack that requires minimal preparation.","input":"","output":"A healthy snack that requires minimal preparation is a piece of fruit and a small handful of nuts or seeds.
