It is a form of communication, an expression of emotions, and a source of knowledge. Music education is essential in helping students to become more creative, find their identity, and learn more about the world around them. \n\nFirst of all, music education encourages creativity. This is especially relevant in todayâ€™s world where technology dominates most aspects of communication. Creative music activities and improvisation help to foster the necessary skills that a student needs to utilize today's technological capabilities in different ways. Ideas are expressed through composition, improvisation and performance of music, which forms a creative outlet for students to let go of things they are not able to express in more traditional forms.\n\nFurthermore, music education helps to strengthen identity and build confidence. Playing music allows for students to develop their own unique style of self-expression, which fosters an understanding of one's own identity. This helps them to recognize their uniqueness, which is essential in order to develop a strong sense of self-confidence. The sense of accomplishment from learning a new instrument or perfecting a piece of music can be highly rewarding for the student and can go a long way in building self-esteem and self-motivation. \n\nFinally, music education helps to educate students about other cultures and the world. By learning and performing pieces from other cultures, students learn about different nuances of sound and rhythm that they wouldn't otherwise hear. For example, learning a piece of music from India will open the student to new ideas of rhythm and scale that they never encountered before. They can gain insight into a culture they are not already familiar with and expand their world view. \n\nAll in all, music education is an essential part of a student's overall educational experience. It offers them the opportunity to learn, create and express themselves, while also providing a platform to build identity, confidence and cultural awareness. Music education is essential in today's world, as it gives students the opportunity to explore their talents and help them grow as confident individuals."},{"instruction":"Single out the names from the following sentence.","input":"My brother Tom and sister Jane are coming over to visit.","output":"Tom\nJane"},{"instruction":"Name five animals that have feathers.","input":"","output":"Chicken, duck, eagle, peacock, hummingbird."},{"instruction":"Read the instructions and then compose a to-do list.","input":"Go grocery shopping, clean up your bedroom, finish the project report.","output":"To-do list: \n1.
