A non-competitive inhibitor binds to a site on the enzyme other than the active site and changes the enzyme's shape so that the substrate can no longer bind to it, thus also blocking the enzyme's activity. Both competitive and non-competitive inhibitors reduce the enzyme's activity, but the effect of a competitive inhibitor can be reversed by an increased concentration of the substrate. A non-competitive inhibitor's effects are generally not reversible."},{"instruction":"Create a new logo for a furniture store","input":"Name of the store: Value Furniture","output":"As a large language model, I am unable to generate visual data."},{"instruction":"Generate a headline for a blog post about machine learning.","input":"","output":"Unlocking the Power of Machine Learning for the Next Generation of Businesses."},{"instruction":"Replace the words in bold with synonms","input":"She arrived late for the meeting and it made me apprehensive.","output":"She arrived tardy for the meeting and it made me uneasy."},{"instruction":"Create a business plan executive summary","input":"Company Name: Cargo\nVision: Create an end-to-end logistics marketplace","output":"Cargo is a logistics marketplace that brings together the fragmented market of shipping, logistics and transport services.
