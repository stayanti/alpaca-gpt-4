Chlorophyll absorbs light energy, which plants use to create food (glucose) through a process known as photosynthesis. This energy is also used to help absorb water and carbon dioxide. The chlorophyll's green color is reflected back to our eyes, making plants look green. The other pigments in plants such as carotenoids (yellow and orange), anthocyanins (red and violet), and betalains (magenta) are also present but in lesser quantities and are either masked or tossed away from the plant."},{"instruction":"Generate a list of potential questions for an interviewee who is applying for a job as a data analyst.","input":"","output":"1.
