There, he noticed a little girl who was crying. Concerned, Pongo walked towards her and asked her what was wrong. The little girl didn't seem to understand him, but eventually she managed to blurt out that she had lost her doll. \n\nPongo, not one to give up easily, began to search around the park for the doll, sniffing around trees and peeking behind benches.

She was filled with joy and wrapped her arms around Pongo, thanking him for finding her lost doll.
