[{"instruction":"Compose an essay that compares and contrasts communism and capitalism.","input":"","output":"Communism and capitalism are two of the most prominent economic systems in the world. Communism is based on the theory of \"from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,\" meaning goods and services are provided to individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status or ability to pay for them. In contrast, capitalism is based on transactions between buyers and sellers, implying goods and services can only be acquired if individuals have the necessary resources to pay for them. Communism is a state-controlled system, and the government regulates the production and distribution of goods and services, while capitalism is a free-market economy completely driven by the forces of the market and private enterprise. In a communist setting, resources are shared among all members of the community, while in a capitalist setting, individuals decide how and when to consume goods and services based on their ability to pay. Communism aims to eliminate inequality and provide opportunity for all, while capitalism creates a more competitive environment. Communism focuses on the collective good, while capitalism focuses on private gain. Both systems have their own advantages and weaknesses, but together they create a balanced economic system that harnesses the strengths of both."},{"instruction":"For the given text, identify three obscure words and use them in a sentence.","input":"The little girl walked down the street carrying an umbrella.","output":"The little girl paraded down the street with her umbrella, her visage expressed jocundity.
