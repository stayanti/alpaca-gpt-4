Artificial Intelligence is concerned with creating intelligent systems from a computer’s perspective, while Machine Learning concerns itself with understanding data from a statistical perspective. Furthermore, Machine Learning algorithms can be used to perform many tasks related to Artificial Intelligence, such as recognizing patterns in data, making decisions, and predicting future outcomes. Finally, Artificial Intelligence is often used as a tool to achieve goals set by the Machine Learning algorithm."}]
