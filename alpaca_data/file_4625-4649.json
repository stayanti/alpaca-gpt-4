[{"instruction":"Explain why a computer cannot make decisions the same way human can?","input":"","output":"A computer cannot make decisions the same way humans can because computers work based on a set of instructions and predetermined algorithms while humans can make decisions based on experience, intuition, and emotions. Computers are limited to the exact set of instructions they are programmed with, while humans can use past experiences, their current emotions and other subjective criteria to make decisions. Humans can also take into account unexpected and unmeasurable criteria like context, pressure, or motivation to decide the best course of action which computers cannot do. So, computers are not capable of making decisions the same way humans can."},{"instruction":"Select the right keyword for these text snippets.","input":"Snippet 1: \"I am looking for a new job\"\nSnippet 2: \"I want to start my own business\"","output":"Snippet 1: Job Search \nSnippet 2: Entrepreneurship"},{"instruction":"Suggest a unique way to spend the weekend in your city.","input":"","output":"If you're looking for a unique way to spend the weekend in my city, I'd recommend visiting the local farmer's market.
