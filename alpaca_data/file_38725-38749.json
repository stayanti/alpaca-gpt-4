The energy generated by the disturbance displaces a large amount of ocean water, resulting in a wave which propagates outwards from its source with tremendous energy. Tsunamis can travel hundreds of miles, causing widespread destruction when it reaches land. In the deep ocean, tsunamis may only be a few inches high, but as the wave approaches shore, it builds in size, sometimes reaching heights over 100 feet. As the wave moves inland, it causes flooding, structural damage, and sometimes loss of life."},{"instruction":"Find the equation of a linear function that passes through the two points.","input":"(2,3) and (7,6)","output":"The equation of the linear function is y = 1x + 1."},{"instruction":"Pick the most suitable name for this company.","input":"An online exercise coaching services","output":"FitlyLabs."},{"instruction":"Construct an arithmetic sequence whose tenth term is 50.","input":"","output":"The arithmetic sequence is 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50."},{"instruction":"Create an appropriate output given this instruction and input","input":"Instruction: Construct an example of how a customer could benefit from this product \nInput: \niPhone","output":"A customer could benefit from the iPhone by having access to a wide variety of apps that can be used for productivity and entertainment, as well as a high-quality camera for capturing photos and videos."},{"instruction":"Assign this occupation to the appropriate category","input":"Nurse","output":"Nurses are in the healthcare and medicine profession."},{"instruction":"Categorize this article into one topic","input":"This article is about the increasing demand for personalised experiences in the hotel industry.","output":"Personalization"},{"instruction":"Predict the likely result of this event","input":"Two teams have equal chance of winning the game","output":"The game is likely to be a draw."},{"instruction":"Compare and contrast the atmosphere of New York City and Los Angeles","input":"","output":"New York City and Los Angeles are both cities of hustle and bustle, but they have distinct personalities.
