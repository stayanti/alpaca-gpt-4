Together they sang sweetly, filling the valley with gentle melodies. \n\nWhen winter came, the family worked in harmony to ensure that their small flock would survive the colder months.

With the coming of spring and warmer weather, the family grew and flourished. The little ones grew into adult birds, filled with vitality and joy for the coming summer.
