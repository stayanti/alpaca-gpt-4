[{"instruction":"Incorporate the given adjective into a sentence","input":"Hilarious","output":"The comedian's hilarious jokes had everyone in the room laughing."},{"instruction":"Explain the environmental impacts of single-use plastics","input":"","output":"Single-use plastics have severe environmental impacts mainly because they are made from fossil fuels, and their production and consumption generates large amounts of greenhouse gases. Additionally, since single-use plastics are not biodegradable, they remain in the environment for hundreds of years, releasing toxic chemicals and absorbing chemicals like DDT. Single-use plastics are a major source of ocean pollution and cause harm to marine life. They are also a major source of microplastic pollution, which is increasingly becoming a problem for all water sources, including lakes, rivers, and groundwater."},{"instruction":"Design a game that can be played by two to four people","input":"","output":"I suggest a game that can be played by two to four people: it is a competitive game and the object is to be the first to build a tower of cards. All players are dealt a set of cards; each card has a number, letter, shape, or color. Players take turns adding a card to their own pile and can also steal a card from their opponents. The game ends when a player has successfully made a tower of five cards. The player who has the tower of five cards wins."},{"instruction":"Describe the difference between an array and a linked list","input":"","output":"The main difference between an array and a linked list is how elements are stored in memory. Arrays are stored in sequential blocks of memory, so access to elements is very fast. On the other hand, linked lists are composed of multiple nodes linked together by links. Each node contains a piece of data and a pointer to the next node, so elements in a linked list don't need to be stored in a particular order. Consequently, linked lists have slower access times, but they are more flexible and can be extended more easily."},{"instruction":"What is bubble sort?","input":"","output":"Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list being sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. It is generally considered to be one of the simplest sorting algorithms to understand, but it is still inefficient as its running time is O(n2). Bubble sort also has limited uses in practical applications as it is significantly less efficient than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort."},{"instruction":"Convert the following number from base 7 to base 5.","input":"Number: 17","output":"35"},{"instruction":"What is the partial derivative of 3x2y with respect to x?","input":"","output":"The partial derivative of 3x2y with respect to x is 6xy."},{"instruction":"Create an algorithm that draws a circle in 3D space.","input":"","output":"The algorithm for drawing a circle in 3D space is as follows:\n1.

It occurs when two or more threads or processes are reading or writing to the same resource, and the outcome of the program depends upon which thread finishes first. For example, if Thread A reads a value from memory, updates it, and then writes it back, while Thread B also reads the same value, updates it, then writes its own updated value, then both threads may be racing to write their new value first, resulting in an unexpected outcome for the program."},{"instruction":"Identify the number of positive integers less than 100 that are both multiples of 6 and 7.","input":"","output":"There are 12 positive integers less than 100 that are both multiples of 6 and 7.
