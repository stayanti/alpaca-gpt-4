Transfer learning can also be used to quickly customize an existing model to the specific classification needs of a new domain or dataset. Additionally, existing models offer a measure of validation, as they have already been tested on data and have successfully completed a task in a certain domain. This offers a certain degree of certainty that the model will be able to achieve the desired outcome. Furthermore, some existing models are open-source and could be accessed at no cost. Lastly, if the classification model is used for a difficult task and is developed by experts, there is a higher likelihood that the model will outperform the accuracy of a newly created model."}]
