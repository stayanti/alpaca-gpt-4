Nuclear energy requires a large capital investment to build and maintain a nuclear power plant, but produces more energy at a lower cost than solar. Solar energy is more affordable, but may require a large upfront investment in infrastructure and panels. Nuclear energy is generally thought to be more reliable than solar in terms of consistent electricity production, while solar energy relies on weather conditions in order to produce. Additionally, nuclear energy produces much higher levels of radioactive waste that must be safely disposed whereas solar energy produces little to no waste."},{"instruction":"Write a dialogue between two friends discussing the current state of the economy.","input":"","output":"Friend 1: Have you been following the news lately?

The algorithm for solving this puzzle includes a breadth-first search technique. This involves creating a list of nodes that contains the puzzle’s current state (position and order of squares) as well as previous states (to minimize searching duplicate states). The algorithm then proceeds to move each tile to the blank space and evaluate if the resulting new state is a goal node (i.e. end of the puzzle). If it is not, the program moves on to the next node, keeping track of the nodes already visited and continuously recording the new states for further evaluation. Once the goal node is identified, the program calculates the optimal path from the start node to the goal node."},{"instruction":"Describe the application development life cycle.","input":"","output":"The application development life cycle (ADLC) is a process for managing the development of a software application, from conception to deployment. There are generally six distinct phases in the ADLC: planning, analysis, design, implementation and testing, deployment and maintenance. In the planning phase, stakeholders need to evaluate project objectives and decide which type of software should be used. During the analysis phase, stakeholders will review the system requirements in detail and develop a business plan. In the design phase, the system architecture and designs, including user interfaces and databases, are determined. During implementation and testing, the code is written and tested for bugs and then deployed, after which regular maintenance and updates should be conducted."},{"instruction":"Identify possible solutions to the problems of climate change.","input":"","output":"Climate change is one of the biggest global challenges of our time.
