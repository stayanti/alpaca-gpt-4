This rise in temperature is largely the result of human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels like oil and coal, which release large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap the sun’s heat within the earth’s atmosphere and lead to warming.\n\nGlobal warming has serious implications for the planet. Rising sea levels, extreme weather events and flooding, prolonged droughts, and heat waves are all some of the consequences of global warming. Over time, this can lead to the displacement and loss of habitats for many species, as well as food and water shortages and significant damage to the environment.\n\nFortunately, global warming can be mitigated by reducing emissions and switching to clean energy sources. This includes widespread implementation of renewable sources of energy, such as solar, wind, and hydro. Individuals can also contribute to the fight against global warming by switching to low-carbon forms of transportation, such as walking and biking, and by performing energy-saving practices like unplugging unused electronics and appliances. \n\nIt is critical that we take action now to address global warming and to ensure that the planet and its inhabitants are protected for future generations."},{"instruction":"List 5 famous historical figures","input":"","output":"1.
