[{"instruction":"Compare and contrast geometric and arithmetic progressions.","input":"","output":"Both geometric and arithmetic progressions are series of numbers that follow a certain pattern. In an Arithmetic Progression (AP), each term is found by adding a constant value to the previous term. On the other hand, in a Geometric Progression (GP), each term is found by multiplying the previous term by constant value. While an AP involves the addition of numbers, a GP involves the multiplication of numbers. Additionally, the sum of terms in an AP over time will approach infinity, while the sum of terms in a GP will eventually settle at a fixed value."},{"instruction":"Describe the process of how a loan application is verified.","input":"","output":"When a person takes out a loan, the lender must verify the borrower's identity and creditworthiness. This process involves the lender verifying the applicant's income, reviewing the repayment terms and interest rate, making sure the applicant does not have any lien or bankruptcy proceedings against them, and assessing the risk of the loan. The lender may also perform a background check to make sure that the borrower has a good employment and financial history. Once the loan application is approved, it will be sent to the lender, who will then release the loan if they find it appropriate."},{"instruction":"What is the probability of rolling a total of 13 when rolling two dice?","input":"","output":"The probability of rolling a total of 13 when rolling two dice is 2/36 or 1/18. This is because there are two possible combinations that will produce a total of 13 when rolling two dice - 6 and 7, and 5 and 8. To calculate the probability, divide the number of possible combinations (2) by the total number of combinations (36). Thus, the probability of rolling a total of 13 when rolling two dice is 2/36 or 1/18."},{"instruction":"Give a short description of the term 'population-level interoperability'.","input":"","output":"Population-level interoperability is the ability of a healthcare system to integrate real-time data between multiple entities, including different hospitals, medical practices, and other providers.

The algorithm begins by setting up two cases, one for n = 0 and the other for n = 1. If n = 0 or 1, the function simply returns the value of n.  If n is larger than 1, the function recursively calls itself twice, once for n-1 and once for n-2. The result of these recursive calls is added together to compute the Fibonacci number for n."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this sentence adding a simile:","input":"He was a silent person.","output":"He was a silent person, like a mouse in a room of cats."},{"instruction":"Name a movie that was released in the '90s","input":"","output":"The Lion King (1994)"},{"instruction":"Identify the major characters in the novel Romeo and Juliet","input":"","output":"The major characters in the novel Romeo and Juliet are Romeo, Juliet, Friar Lawrence, Mercutio, Tybalt, the Nurse, and Friar John."},{"instruction":"Analyze the benefits of digital marketing","input":"","output":"Digital marketing offers many advantages over traditional marketing methods.
