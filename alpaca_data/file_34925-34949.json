Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are composed of multiple layers of neurons that are interconnected, but they are organized in a manner that preserves the spatial relationship between the input and the output.\n\n- ANNs can process numerical data and vector representations of inputs. CNNs are specialized for image recognition and can process image-related data such as pixels in an image.\n\n- ANNs use back-propagation and gradient descent to optimize the weights in the network. CNNs use a technique called “convolution”, where pixels are moved through the network to detect features in the data.\n\n- ANNs are more general in nature and can be used for a variety of tasks. CNNs are more specialized, and are typically used for tasks like image recognition, object detection, generation of images, and natural language processing."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that illustrates the concept of \"adaptability\".","input":"","output":"She quickly adapted to the changing environment, demonstrating her ability to remain resilient in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"Suggest three textbooks that could be used to learn machine learning.","input":"","output":"Three textbooks that could be used to learn machine learning are “An Introduction to Statistical Learning” by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani, “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow” by Aurélien Géron, and “Deep Learning” by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville."},{"instruction":"How can a budget be used to help monitor one's spending habits?","input":"","output":"A budget can be used to help monitor one's spending habits by setting limits and goals that outline how much money can be spent in different areas.
