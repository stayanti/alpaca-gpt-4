[{"instruction":"Synthesize an article on the potential pitfalls of relying too heavily on AI.","input":"","output":"AI is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, with many industries relying heavily on the technology for various tasks. But the increasing dependence on AI, coupled with its current limitations, can lead to many potential pitfalls that can have significant economic and social implications. For example, reliance on AI may lead to slower decisions than those made by humans and can lead to unintended biases in decision making. Additionally, AI is often internalized within a company, and so changes in the conditions of the problem can go unnoticed and lead to inaccurate results, which can be costly for businesses. AI also requires a great deal of data to train and maintain, and if that data is not appropriately collected, managed and secured, it can expose businesses and customers to malicious entities. With the risks associated with AI so clearly evident, companies need to be proactive in minimizing these risks and put in place appropriate safeguards to ensure the safe and effective use of the technology."},{"instruction":"What is the probability that it will rain tomorrow?","input":"","output":"It is not possible to give an exact probability of rain tomorrow as it depends on many factors such as the location, season, temperature and humidity.
