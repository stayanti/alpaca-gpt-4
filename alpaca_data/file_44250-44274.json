A heap is a data structure that allows for efficient operations such as insert, delete, and sorting. In a heap sort algorithm, the root element of the heap is compared with its children and swapped with the larger of its two children until the order of the elements has been established. Then, the next-smallest element is removed from the root and the heap remains valid. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted."},{"instruction":"Classify this plant as a fruit, vegetable, or nut.","input":"Banana","output":"Fruit."},{"instruction":"To compress the paragraph into two sentences, how would you summarize it?","input":"The sun is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium with trace amounts of other elements.
