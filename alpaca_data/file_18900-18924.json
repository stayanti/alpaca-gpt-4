On the other hand, dogs are larger than cats and have a sturdier body with a thick and stubby tail. They have greater physical strength than cats and can run faster too. \n\nCats and dogs also have different behaviors. Cats spend a lot of time sleeping, grooming themselves, and playing with toys. They tend to shun human physical affection and are often aloof and independent. Dogs, on the other hand, are often affectionate and crave human touch and attention. They are also more active than cats and are always seeking to explore their environment and are content to play with humans or other animals. \n\nIn terms of personality, cats and dogs also have their distinct traits. Cats can be mischievous, often cute and sometimes mysterious. They can be quite independent, preferring to sit on a windowsill or relax in an armchair during their leisure time. Dogs, on the other hand, are loyal, often playful and omniscient. They can be quite obedient, and in their spare time, they usually like to go out on walks with their owners or to play a game of fetch. \n\nOverall, cats and dogs are different in many ways, right from their physical attributes to their personalities. These differences make them endearing in their own special way, and remind us why it is so great to be an animal lover."},{"instruction":"What is the formula for the acceleration due to gravity?","input":"","output":"The formula for the acceleration due to gravity is g = G * m / r2, where G is the gravitational constant, m is the mass of the object, and r is the distance between the object and the center of the object being gravitationally attracted."},{"instruction":"Write a one-sentence explanation for the following phrase: \"Zero-sum game\".","input":"","output":"A zero-sum game is a situation in which one person’s gain is exactly equal to another person’s loss."},{"instruction":"Rearrange the following words to form an adjective phrase.","input":"beautiful incredibly","output":"incredibly beautiful"},{"instruction":"Explain why people find it difficult to commit.","input":"","output":"People find it difficult to commit for a variety of reasons.
