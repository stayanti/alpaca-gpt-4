This theorem can be used in cryptography today to test whether a given number is prime or not. In order to use Fermat's Little Theorem, one must select a number a randomly and test whether a^(p-1) - 1 is divisible by p. If yes, then the given number is most likely prime."},{"instruction":"Describe a situation when a friend is cheating on a test and what should one should do about it.","input":"","output":"A friend cheating on a test is an ethical dilemma that can be difficult to navigate.
