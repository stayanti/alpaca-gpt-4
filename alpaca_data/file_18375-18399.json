He was born on 13 May 1882 in Argenteuil, a commune in the northwestern suburbs of Paris, France. From a young age he was surrounded by art, as his father and grandfather were house painters and decorators. This, coupled with training at the Académie Humbert, helped Braque foster his skills in painting and sculpture. \n\nIn his earlier career, Braque focused mainly on Fauvism and Post-Impressionism. He developed an affinity for the latter due to its use of vibrant colors and distorted perspective. It was while exploring this latter style that he met Henri Matisse. From then onwards, Braque and Matisse created works of art together, which heavily influence the emergence of Cubism. Their styles, along with the use of multiple perspectives, were integrated together to form this new movement. These techniques have become integral to modern art to this day. \n\nBraque himself evolved the Cubism style through his experiments with still life painting, alongside his exploration into abstract art. After his death in 1963, France awarded Braque the National Order of Merit for his immense contribution to art and culture."},{"instruction":"You are required to generate a story with a given beginning.\n\nBeginning:\n\nThe sun was setting, and the sky was filled with a golden and pink hue.","input":"","output":"As the sun continued to descend, people began to gather around to share stories and watch the beauty of the sky.
