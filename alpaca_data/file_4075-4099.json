It is broken down into two stages, the Light-dependent Reaction and the Calvin Cycle. During the Light-dependent Reaction, light energy is used to split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct, and is then used to produce ATP and NADPH. During the Calvin Cycle, the ATP and NADPH from the Light-dependent Reaction are used to produce glucose, releasing oxygen in the process. Photosynthesis is responsible for the production of the oxygen cycle on Earth, as well as for the production of most of the organic compounds in the biosphere."},{"instruction":"Summarize this article in 2 sentences in your own words.","input":"In December 2017, an artificial intelligence (AI) program called AlphaGo Zero beat the best-ever version of itself in an ancient Chinese board game called Go.
