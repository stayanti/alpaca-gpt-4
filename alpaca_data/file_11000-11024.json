Random Forest is an ensemble machine learning technique, where the model creates a set of decision trees and the result or prediction is the average of the predictions from all the decision trees. On the other hand, Support Vector Machines is a supervised learning model which attempts to maximize the margin between two classes of data points by identifying hyperplanes in a given dataset. This makes it useful for classification and regression tasks.
