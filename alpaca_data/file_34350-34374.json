Yeats","output":"Both poems explore the idea of autonomy and self-direction. In \"The Road Not Taken\" by Robert Frost, two roads diverge and the speaker reflects on what his decision of which to take will mean for his life and his future. The poem is ultimately about individual decision making and accepting the consequences. Meanwhile, in W.B. Yeats' \"The Lake Isle of Innisfree\", the desire for autonomy and to leave the busy city life for the peace and tranquility of a rural lifestyle is expressed. However, this poem is more about returning to a nostalgic home and romanticising the past, rather than making a decision about the future. Both poems present a longing for freedom and a need to break free from the everyday, but the execution of their messages is quite distinct."},{"instruction":"Format the following text into a 5-paragraph essay.","input":"Violence towards animals is a moral issue that deserves to be taken seriously.
