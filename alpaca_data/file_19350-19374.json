This block chain is resistant to alterations and can only be updated with the consensus of the network. These blocks are linked with a cryptographic hash, so that any changes made to the data will be immediately detected.\n\nBlockchain technology has a wide range of applications beyond digital currency, such as identity management, smart contracts, data storage, and verification of digital assets."},{"instruction":"Give an example of an online course and explain why it is beneficial.","input":"","output":"One example of an online course is an introductory course on digital marketing.
