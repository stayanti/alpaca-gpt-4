With continued warming trends, melting ice caps and glaciers, and rising sea levels, the potential for further degradation of our environment is increasingly probable. It is more important than ever that responsible citizens and governments take action to protect our environment and ensure a healthy planet for future generations to come. \n\nTo make meaningful progress, we must consider both natural and man-made factors that contribute to climate change. For example, the burning of fossil fuels releases gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat within the atmosphere, warming the planet. To help limit the effects of this process, we must reduce our collective carbon footprint. This means reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, investing in renewable energy resources, and enacting policies that reduce the total amount of greenhouse gas pollution. \n\nThough change is difficult and uncomfortable, we must take action to ensure a hospitable planet for generations to come. We must start now, as every day of delay increases the risks we face. Scientists around the world are in agreement that climate change is a real and present danger that requires immediate and decisive action."},{"instruction":"Generate the full name of a famous actor born in the 1980s.","input":"","output":"Tom Hanks."},{"instruction":"Re-organize the given text so that it describes a narrative.","input":"They drove to the beach, and the sun was shining.
