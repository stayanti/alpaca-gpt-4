It was fought primarily in Europe, between the Allied Powers and the Central Powers. Its causes can be traced back to the rivalry between the European colonial powers of France and Germany, and their respective allies. As a result of the war, the German Empire was abolished, and a new set of political arrangements was established in Europe. The aftermath of the war also spurred a massive transformation of global politics, economy, and culture, which continued into the mid-20th century. WWI was the first major war since the introduction of complex machinery and new technologies, such as tanks, machine guns, and chemical warfare.
