Language understanding analyzes the structure of text to identify concepts, entities, or topics, among other features. Language generation is the process of taking information from the understanding step and transforming it into natural language. Finally, dialog management incorporates context from preceding conversations to enable back-and-forth dialogue between the user and the system."}]
