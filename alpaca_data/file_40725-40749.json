Online stores typically eliminate the need for a customer to travel to the store, whereas a brick-and-mortar store requires a customer to physically enter the store in order to purchase goods. Additionally, online stores normally have access to a much larger range of products due to the amount of vendors who are able to list and ship goods worldwide, whereas a brick-and-mortar store may only have access to goods from certain locations or from certain vendors."}]
