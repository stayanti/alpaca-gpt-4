The continental slope is the steep decline that leads to the deep ocean, reaching depths of up to three miles. The ocean floor consists of plains and trenches, with the Mariana Trench being the deepest trench at over 11,000 meters deep.

Natural selection is the process by which individuals who are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their traits to their offspring. This process leads to the formation of new species and allows for adaptation in a changing environment. \n\nIn addition, the theory of evolution explains how new genetic variations arise, how organisms acquire inherited traits, and how species diverge with time."},{"instruction":"Brainstorm strategies to reduce food waste.","input":"","output":"Strategies to reduce food waste include proper food storage and preservation, educating consumers on portion sizes, using leftovers creatively, using recipes that use up food scraps, donating excess food to food banks, composting, and encouraging people to \"embrace the ugly vegetables\" by purchasing slightly imperfect produce."},{"instruction":"Name three elements in the periodic table.","input":"","output":"Three elements in the periodic table are oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen."},{"instruction":"Generate three questions that could be asked on computer science.","input":"","output":"What is the importance of Big O notation in computer science?\nWhat is the difference between an algorithm and a program? \nWhat is the role of artificial intelligence in computer science?"},{"instruction":"Classify an input string as either a noun or a verb.","input":"run","output":"Verb."},{"instruction":"Regroup the following words from lowest to highest based on their level of formality.","input":"yelling, speaking, shouting","output":"speaking, shouting, yelling"},{"instruction":"Convert the following equation from infix notation to postfix notation.","input":"3 + 4","output":"3 4 +"},{"instruction":"Rewrite the following sentence to show contrast.","input":"John was eager to go to school.","output":"John was not keen to stay at home."},{"instruction":"Insert the correct punctuation at the provided places in the following sentence.","input":"Jane silently opened the door","output":"Jane, silently opened the door."},{"instruction":"Complete a sentence that means the same as the following sentence, but is more concise:","input":"He had no idea what I was talking about.","output":"He was clueless."},{"instruction":"Compute the area of a rectangle where the lenght is 5 cm and the width is 2 cm.","input":"","output":"10 cm^2"},{"instruction":"Name a popular amusement park in Europe","input":"","output":"TusenFryd Amusement Park in Norway."},{"instruction":"Find all the words that begin with the letter \"g\"","input":"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog","output":"The words that begin with the letter \"g\" are: \n\n- \"Great\"\n- \"Fox\"\n- \"Jumps\"\n- \"Dog\""},{"instruction":"List three Mediterranean countries","input":"","output":"Three countries in the Mediterranean are Italy, Greece, and Turkey."},{"instruction":"Convert 20 inches to centimetres","input":"","output":"20 inches * 2.54 centimeters/inch = 50.8 centimeters"},{"instruction":"Tell me a horror story that takes place in an abandoned house.","input":"","output":"I was walking through the woods on a cold, dark evening when I stumbled upon an old, abandoned house.
