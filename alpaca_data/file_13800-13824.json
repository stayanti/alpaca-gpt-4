Weather is the short-term atmospheric conditions that occur over a single day, or even a few hours. It consists of temperature, precipitation, thunderstorms, winds and other short-term atmospheric phenomena and is constantly changing. Climate, on the other hand, is the average weather conditions that occur over a long period of time (usually at least 30 years), and is relatively consistent in an area. Climate is the result of many factors, such as latitude, elevation, topography, wind patterns and seasonal variations. While weather and climate are related, they are not the same. Weather is the atmospheric condition of a given day or location, while climate is what we can expect from the atmosphere over a much longer period of time."},{"instruction":"Create a poem about love that rhymes.","input":"","output":"Love is a rose, that no eye can see \nIt blooms up high, in the heart of me \nIt makes me feel like I'm soaring high \nMy heart full of joy and with no goodbye \n\nLove's like a river, that cannot dry \nIt's gentle flow, passes me by \nLike a steady flame, it will never depart \nProtecting me safe, in its warmest heart \n\nLove makes me strong, to face each day \nIt will never weaken, no matter what may \nIt fills me with hope, when the clouds roll in \nLove gives me strength, to battle the wind."},{"instruction":"Design a machine learning algorithm for predicting stock prices.","input":"","output":"The machine learning algorithm designed for predicting stock prices should be a supervised learning task using a deep neural network.
