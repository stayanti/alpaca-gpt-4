To understand how the pandemic affected literacy education in rural India, data were collected from parents, teachers, school administrators and students in seven rural schools of northern India. Results indicated that the pandemic had a negative impact on literacy programs in rural India, leading to closure of schools; decreased access to education for students; disruption of the teaching-learning process; and lack of availability of learning materials. Moreover, the pandemic aggravated existing issues such as gender inequality in literacy education, as girls were more affected by school closures. The results of this study can provide useful information to policymakers and educators to take necessary steps to recover the educational losses caused by the pandemic in rural India."},{"instruction":"Describe a time you had to work with someone difficult","input":"","output":"I once worked closely with a colleague who was difficult to deal with.
