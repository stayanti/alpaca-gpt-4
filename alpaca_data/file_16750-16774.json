Another major difference between team sports and individual sports is the differing requirements for practice. In team sports, players must often practice together. In individual sports, however, practice is individualized, allowing players to tailor practices to their own strengths and weaknesses."},{"instruction":"Identify the type of poem from the following poem excerpt.","input":"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan\nA stately pleasure-dome decree;","output":"This is an example of a Romantic poem."},{"instruction":"What is the digital marketing strategy for a new idea?","input":"Promoting a subscription-based meal delivery service.","output":"A successful digital marketing strategy for a new subscription-based meal delivery service should include elements of user acquisition optimization, content marketing, search engine optimization, and social media marketing.
