OOP encourages code reuse and extensibility with an emphasis on code organization and modularity. It also relies heavily on classes, which define how objects should behave, and objects that follow the rules defined by the classes.\n\nFunctional programming focuses on the evaluation of expressions and functions that take inputs and return outputs. It avoids using shared state or mutable data, instead opting to use pure functions. The emphasis on declarative programming and stateless functions makes FP code easier to debug, test and reuse.\n\nIn OOP, the underlying methodology of programming revolves around objects and methods. Whereas, in Functional Programming, the underlying methodology revolves around mathematical functions. OOP uses classes as templates for objects that represent real-world entities, whereas FP relies heavily on composition to create functions from simpler ones. Finally, OOP emphasizes on mutable data, whereas FP emphasizes on immutable data."},{"instruction":"Compose a tweet explaining why Python is a popular programming language.","input":"","output":"Python is a popular programming language thanks to its efficient code, easy-to-use syntax, robust libraries, scalability and flexibility for developers. #Programming #Python #Developers"},{"instruction":"Rewrite the following statement using formal English.","input":"She ain't got no money.","output":"She does not have any money."},{"instruction":"Find and explain the fallacy in the following argument.","input":"All birds can fly, so all mammals must be able to fly as well.","output":"This argument is a false analogy because it assumes a causative relationship between two unrelated categories (birds and mammals).

This is a multi-step optimization technique and is used for both supervised and unsupervised learning problems.
