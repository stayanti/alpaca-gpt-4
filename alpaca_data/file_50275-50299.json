However, a wealth of information has been obtained from cHL cell lines. Here we report results of whole-exome sequencing and karyotypic analysis of five cHL cell lines. Four genes with potentially pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNV) were detected in three cell lines. SNV were also detected in seventeen HL-related genes and three mitosis-related genes. Copy number variants were detected in four HL-related genes in all five cell lines. Given the high degree of aneuploidy in HL, mitosis-related genes were screened for defects. One mitotic gene (NCAPD2) was amplified in all five HL cell lines, and two genes (FAM190A, PLK4) were amplified in four cell lines. These results suggest that genomic instability of HL may be due to defects in genes involved in chromosome duplication and segregation.","output":"The article discusses the challenges of genetic analysis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) due to limited cell availability. However, results of whole-exome sequencing and karyotypic analysis of five cHL cell lines have provided information on potentially pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNV) in several genes, as well as copy number variants in HL-related genes. The study also suggests that defects in genes involved in chromosome duplication and segregation may contribute to the genomic instability of HL."},{"instruction":"Provide a real-world example of the following concept.","input":"Natural selection","output":"A real-world example of natural selection can be seen in the Galápagos finches.

As a result, the finches with the longest beaks were more common in the population."},{"instruction":"What were two repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic on the education system?","input":"","output":"The two biggest repercussions of the coronavirus pandemic on the education system have been the move to digital learning and the widening of educational disparities. The shift to online/virtual learning has had both positive and negative impacts on students, teachers, and parents, but it has created significant disruptions and challenges for many. Furthermore, the pandemic has exacerbated existing educational disparities by pushing students from lower-income families behind even further due to limited access to technology and internet connections. In some cases, the gap between students from low- and high-income backgrounds has grown significantly."},{"instruction":"Describe the importance of sound in a film.","input":"","output":"The sound in a film is incredibly important as it can convey different tones and create a unique atmosphere. It can be used to signify a shift in mood, evoke emotion in its audiences, and give a sense of place and time. For example, horror films may use sharp, sudden notes to increase tension and suspense. Whereas, romantic films may rely on more subtle instruments to build an emotional connection between the characters on-screen. Sound can also be used to emphasize certain moments and enhance the overall experience of watching a film."},{"instruction":"Explain the purpose and need for cleaning agents.","input":"","output":"Cleaning agents are necessary for keeping our environment clean and hygienic.
