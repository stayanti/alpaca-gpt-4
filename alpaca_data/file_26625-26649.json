It is a process where documents are grouped into collections or clusters based on their similarity. Clustering can help in reducing the dimensionality of a large dataset, better understand a document collection by seeing which documents are similar, or discover structures and topics within a group of documents. Unlike text classification, the output of the clustering process is a set of clusters where each cluster contains similar documents."},{"instruction":"Create a Coding Challenge for a beginner programmer that requires to print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.","input":"","output":"Write a program that takes a number n as input and prints the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
