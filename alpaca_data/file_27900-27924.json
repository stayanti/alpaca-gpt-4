In the first stanza, the traveler expresses admiration for the two paths lying before him, noting the impossibility of traveling them both.

The traveler senses that his decision to take the untrodden path will influence the direction of his life and the decisions he will make in the future. \n\nThe narrator celebrates his daring choice and acknowledges the uncertainty of his path. Through the poem, Frost conveys the idea that life is filled with choices that we must make—and that the decisions we make will shape our lives.

It is enjoyed by people of all ages and cultures in many different countries. While pizza may seem like a modern food, its history goes back centuries. \n\nThe earliest recorded reference to pizza dates back to the 10th century in Gaeta, Italy. The pizza of the time consisted of flatbread and herbs, similar to focaccia. This type of pizza was mainly eaten by peasant and working classes. In Italy, it wasn’t until the 1700s that tomatoes were used as a pizza topping, and it wasn’t until the late 19th century that the popular pizza we know today started to become popular.\n\nIn 1889, Raffaele Esposito of Naples created the classic margherita pizza for visiting royalty. This pizza was made with fresh mozzarella and tomato, reflecting the colors of the Italian flag. It quickly became popular with the masses and soon spread to other countries. \n\nIn the United States, pizza began to gain popularity in the early 1900s. The first American pizzeria was opened in 1905 in New York. By the 1950s, pizza was a popular food choice in the United States, and chains like Pizza Hut and Domino’s started to pop up. \n\nIn more recent times, pizza has continued to evolve. Different types of pizza such as deep dish and stuffed crust have become popular in different parts of the United States. And new toppings like beef, chicken, and vegetarian toppings have been added to the traditional margherita pizza. Pizza is now an international food enjoyed by people around the world. \n\nIn conclusion, pizza is a delicious food that has evolved over centuries. It has spread to different countries and cultures and continues to evolve. From its peasant origins to today, pizza remains a popular food choice and continues to be enjoyed by people of all ages."},{"instruction":"Rewrite the following sentence, changing the verb tense to present perfect.","input":"He thought of an idea.","output":"He has thought of an idea."},{"instruction":"Choose two of the following words and provide an example sentence for each.","input":"bemused; gracious","output":"The bemused politician gave a gracious smile.\nThe gracious employee offered a bemused response."},{"instruction":"How is the following phrase an example of hyperbole?","input":"I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.","output":"It is an example of hyperbole because the speaker is exaggerating their hunger by saying they could eat an animal which is much larger than the typical portion size they would actually consume.
