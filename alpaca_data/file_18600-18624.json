This is because as the Earth’s surface temperature rises, more water is evaporated from the oceans, which in turn increases the amount of water in the atmosphere and leads to more precipitation. This extra volume of water results in an increase in sea levels due to melting ice caps, glaciers and polar ice sheets. Furthermore, the warming of the oceans causes the water to expand, resulting in a further rise in sea levels."},{"instruction":"Explain the purpose of the Linux operating system.","input":"","output":"The Linux operating system is a free and open-source system designed to provide users with a high level of control over their systems.
