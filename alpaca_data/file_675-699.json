Machine learning algorithms rely on a series of manually crafted features and labeled data to train models. Deep learning models, on the other hand, are able to learn complex relationships between data points without the need for manual feature engineering. Deep learning is also capable of multi-layered learning, meaning it can learn multiple abstractions and relationships in the data, while machine learning is often limited to a single layer. Additionally, deep learning models have recently achieved impressive results on many tasks such as object recognition and natural language processing."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence that uses the word ‘zephyr’","input":"","output":"The zephyr wound its way through the fields, bringing a cool breeze with it."},{"instruction":"Based on the following philosophy passage, determine the author’s primary argument","input":"If we are to believe in our most fundamental capacities for understanding the world, we must first pause to look inward and discover our own subjective values and beliefs.

It is a special type of two-dimensional motion in which the object experiences constant acceleration due to the force of gravity. The path of the projectile is parabolic in nature, with the object forming the highest point of its trajectory called the apex. The parabolic path is known as a trajectory, and the maximum height reached by the projectile is called the maximum height. As the object falls, its speed decreases and it eventually lands on the ground."},{"instruction":"Write a function to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius","input":"","output":"def F2C(F):\n    C = (F-32)*(5/9)\n    return C"},{"instruction":"Compute the area of triangle from the given 3 sides","input":"side1=3, side2=4, side3=5","output":"6"},{"instruction":"Prepare a statement of cash flows for the given business.","input":"Net income: $ 7,500\nCash flow from operations: $1,200\nCash flow from investing: $2,100\nCash flow from financing: $3,200","output":"Cash flow statement:\nNet increase in cash: $7,500\nCash flow from operations: $1,200\nCash flow from investing: $2,100\nCash flow from financing: $3,200\nNet cash flow: $6,500"},{"instruction":"Summarize the given paragraph in two sentences.","input":"David was born in 1980.
