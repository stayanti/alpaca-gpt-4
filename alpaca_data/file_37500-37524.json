[{"instruction":"Create an expository essay about global warming.","input":"","output":"Global warming is a threat to our planet and the environment. It is caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation and industrialization that emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These emissions trap heat within the Earth, leading to an increase in global temperatures. \n\nThe effects of global warming are far-reaching and can be catastrophic. The rising temperatures are melting the polar ice caps, leading to a rise in sea levels and flooding of coastal regions. Rising temperatures are also leading to the spread of deserts, ocean acidification and disruption of the environment’s delicate balance. \n\nWhile global warming is a natural phenomenon, human activities have exacerbated the trend and made it more severe. Reducing emissions, promoting renewable energy and investing in innovative solutions are key to mitigating the effects of global warming. Governments need to take urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encourage sustainable practices. \n\nIn conclusion, global warming is a serious threat to our planet, and steps must be taken to reduce emissions and mitigate its effects."},{"instruction":"Do research on the history of poverty in the U.S. and summarize your findings.","input":"","output":"The history of poverty in the United States is a long and complex one. In the early years of the nation, poverty was primarily a rural problem, with the vast majority of the population living in rural areas. Many rural populations were struggling with subsistence farming and small industries which were hardly enough to make a living. By the mid 20th century, however, poverty had become a major issue in the cities, thanks to industrialization, immigration, and displacement of rural populations. \n\nSince then, poverty has been a persistent issue in the United States. Despite significant progress over the last century, there are still millions of people living in poverty. Poverty in the United States is characterized by economic disparities, lack of access to health care and educational opportunities, and a wide income gap. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the poverty crisis, with poverty rates skyrocketing in 20"},{"instruction":"Rewrite the given sentences such that it does not contain any redundancies.","input":"I stayed in my bedroom in my own house that I own.","output":"I stayed in my bedroom in my house."},{"instruction":"Give an example of a food that finds its origin in India.","input":"","output":"Rice and Curry."},{"instruction":"Name one famous scientist.","input":"","output":"Albert Einstein."},{"instruction":"Create a pseudocode for the process of photosynthesis.","input":"","output":"1.

It operates by introducing a fuel, typically gasoline, diesel, or natural gas, and air into a combustion chamber, where it is ignited by a spark plug or other source of ignition. As the fuel burns, it stripes and pushes a piston, which rotates a crankshaft. This rotational motion is used to turn the wheels of the vehicle, thus propelling it forwards."},{"instruction":"Compare and contrast the Pros and cons of using renewable energy sources.","input":"","output":"Renewable energy sources have many advantages compared to fossil fuels. They are generally more sustainable, as they can be replenished much faster than non-renewable sources such as coal, oil and natural gas. Renewable energy sources also create fewer emissions, making them better for the environment. They also do not require as much extraction and transportation as fossil fuels, which reduces the environmental impact associated with their use. Additionally, renewable energy sources can be used to produce electricity and heat, allowing them to complement or even replace traditional sources.\n\nHowever, renewable energy sources come with their own set of disadvantages. For one, many renewable energy sources require large areas of land in order to be installed, meaning they are not as suitable for areas with limited space. Additionally, they tend to be more expensive than traditional energy sources and require high initial investments. Lastly, some renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, are intermittent, meaning they are only available when conditions are favorable."},{"instruction":"Give three examples of the Doppler effect.","input":"","output":"Three examples of the Doppler effect are:\n1.
