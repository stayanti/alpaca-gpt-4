She had a sense of emptiness that nothing seemed to quell. \n\nOne day, while out shopping, Sarah stumbled upon an old bookshop. Despite her reservation, she entered and was immediately taken by the musty aroma of ancient scrolls and leather-bound books. She began to browse, marveling at the sheer volume of knowledge contained within the walls of the shop. It was then, while engrossed in her exploration, that she discovered a book that changed her life. \n\nThe book contained an ancient scripture exhorting the reader to take control of their life. Sarah began to read, and as her eyes trailed along the writing she felt something stir within her. She began to question her life choices, her values, and her vision of the world. This led her to take a journey of self-discovery and inner transformation.\n\nSarah sacrificed the comforts she was accustomed to and began to build a life for herself that was true to her core. She discovered a set of values and beliefs which inspired her and led her to a life of service, compassion, and peace. Sarah had undergone a transformational experience of self-discovery and was determined to live a life that was truly aligned to her highest purpose. \n\nAnd so, with fingers burning with the passion of the journey, Sarah transformed and has never looked back since."},{"instruction":"Insert an appropriate or suitable word for the given context.","input":"I went to the store to buy ____.","output":"I went to the store to buy groceries."},{"instruction":"List at least 3 reasons why it is important to keep a budget.","input":"","output":"There are three important reasons why it is important to keep a budget:\n\n1.

Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.[2]\n\nDeep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks and transformers have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.[3][4][5]\n\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems. ANNs have various differences from biological brains. Specifically, artificial neural networks tend to be static and symbolic, while the biological brain of most living organisms is dynamic (plastic) and analog.[6][7]\n\nThe adjective \"deep\" in deep learning refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Early work showed that a linear perceptron cannot be a universal classifier, but that a network with a nonpolynomial activation function with one hidden layer of unbounded width can. Deep learning is a modern variation that is concerned with an unbounded number of layers of bounded size, which permits practical application and optimized implementation, while retaining theoretical universality under mild conditions. In deep learning the layers are also permitted to be heterogeneous and to deviate widely from biologically informed connectionist models, for the sake of efficiency, trainability and understandability.\n","output":"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves artificial neural networks with multiple layers, and has been successfully applied to fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and drug design. While deep learning architectures are inspired by biological neural networks, they differ in their static and symbolic nature, and their use of multiple layers with nonpolynomial activation functions."},{"instruction":"Execute the following SQL command","input":"SELECT first_name, last_name, SUM(sales) \n    FROM employees\n    GROUP BY first_name, last_name\n    ORDER BY 3 DESC;","output":"This SQL command will select the first and last name, as well as the total sales for each employee.
