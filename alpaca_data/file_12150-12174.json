Then, divide both sides of the equation by 7, giving us x^2 + 2/7x = -1. Finally, completing the square on the left hand side by adding 1/7 and taking the square root yields (x+1/7)^2 = 6/7. Therefore, the equation can be expressed as (x+1/7)^2 = 6/7."},{"instruction":"Find the differences between the US Constitution and the French Constitution of 1958.","input":"","output":"The United States Constitution was ratified in 1787, while the French Constitution of 1958 updated the post-World War II constitution.

Elements in the same group, or column, of the periodic table have the same number of protons and electrons, giving them the same elemental properties. For example, all alkali metals (group 1A) have a single valence electron, giving them similar properties such as low densities and high reactivity. This is because all of their atoms have the same number of protons, electrons, and neutrons."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: How can renewable energy be used to combat climate change?","input":"","output":"Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower can significantly reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and help to mitigate climate change.
