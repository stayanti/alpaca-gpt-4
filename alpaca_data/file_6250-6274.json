When the planet radiates the heat back out as infrared radiation, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb some of the heat and then radiate some of it back down towards the planet, warming it.[1][2][3] Without the greenhouse effect, the Earth's average surface temperature would be about −18 °C (−0.4 °F)[4][5] compared to Earth's actual average surface temperature of approximately 14 °C (57.2 °F).[6] In addition to the naturally present greenhouse gases, human-caused increases in greenhouse gases are trapping greater amounts of heat.[7][8] Burning fossil fuels has increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by about 50% over pre-industrial levels, which is the primary driver for global warming.[9]\r\n\r\nMatter radiates energy at a wavelength related to its temperature. The Sun is about 5,500 °C (9,930 °F), so it emits most of its energy in near infrared and visible wavelengths (as sunlight). The Earth's average surface temperature is about 15 °C (59 °F), so it emits longer-wavelength infrared radiation (radiated heat).[8] Different gases absorb different wavelengths of radiation. Earth's atmosphere is made of gases that are transparent to visible wavelengths of light, allowing sunlight through to heat the surface. Most gases in the atmosphere are also transparent to infrared radiation, but a small proportion of the atmosphere is made up of greenhouse gases that absorb it. These greenhouse gas molecules absorb some of the heat the Earth emits and then re-emit the heat in all directions, passing it to the surrounding air and warming other greenhouse gas molecules. Heat radiated downwards further increases the temperature of the surface, which then returns heat to the atmosphere in a positive feedback cycle.\r\n\r\nA runaway greenhouse effect occurs when greenhouse gases accumulate in the atmosphere through a positive feedback cycle to such an extent that they substantially block radiated heat from escaping into space, thus preventing the planet from cooling.[10] A runaway greenhouse effect involving carbon dioxide and water vapor appears to have occurred on Venus. However, it is unlikely that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions alone could trigger a runaway effect on Earth.\r\n\r\nThe term greenhouse effect comes from a flawed analogy to greenhouses. The primary way greenhouses retain energy from the sun is by preventing the movement of air (blocking convection), although their panels also retain heat by limiting heat radiation and conduction.","output":"The greenhouse effect is a process by which radiation from a planet's atmosphere warms the surface to a temperature above what it would be without its atmosphere. This effect is caused by certain gases in the atmosphere, such as water vapor, that can trap more energy from the sun, warming the surface and making the atmosphere a beneficial force for life on the planet. Without these gases, the average temperature on our planet would be much lower, making life virtually impossible on Earth."},{"instruction":"Classify this sentence as a command, statement or question: \"Please consider this offer.\"","input":"","output":"Command"},{"instruction":"Describe what it means to be brave.","input":"","output":"Being brave means having the courage to face difficult situations and even danger, despite being afraid.
