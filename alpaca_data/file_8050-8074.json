Google's Three Laws are slightly different and state that: 1) A robot must not cause harm to, or through inaction allow harm to, humans; 2) A robot must obey appropriate humans, unless such orders conflict with the First Law; and 3) A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.  Collectively, these laws are meant to ensure that robots and AI are used safely and ethically, without harming humans or disobeying orders from appropriate people."}]
