Algorithms are used in computers, mathematics, and other fields of study to provide reliable and repeatable solutions to complex problems.  By effectively carrying out a set of steps, algorithms can help save time and make calculations much easier.  For example, a sorting algorithm can be used to sort a list of items from highest to lowest (or vice versa) quickly, instead of comparing each item to all the others and sorting one by one. \n\nIn computer science, algorithms can be thought of as the process of providing instructions to a computer to solve a given problem.
