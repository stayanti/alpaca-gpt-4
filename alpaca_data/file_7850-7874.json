Primarily, the protagonist, Santiago, is a representation of how constant loneliness can affect man’s journey. Santiago’s hardships throughout the novel demonstrate how the human condition can lose its will to live in the face of immense loneliness.\n\nThe most glaring example of loneliness felt by Santiago is seen through his steadfast companion and boat mate, a fish he initially names in admiration. Though Santiago loses his prized fish, he names the shark the “Mako Shark” which further symbolises his own loneliness. Throughout the book, Santiago is often seen talking to himself and the fish, and even the salt water, indicating his immense loneliness and desire to communicate with something.\n\nAdditionally, Santiago often talks with the stars in the night sky, as if trying to break his loneliness through conversation. In this sense, the stars are Santiago’s closest friend and provide a source of comfort to him. Even so, in spite of his constant search for companionship and comfort, Santiago is unable to recover from the immense loneliness and becomes a proverbial old man of the sea, travelling alone and seemingly in vain.\n\nEventually, through his patience and courage, Santiago is able to return to the shore, but this is not accompanied by a sense of triumph. Instead, there is a sense of inevitable death and Santiago knows that he will go to a place of solitude, presumably death in his bed, as a result of his loneliness.\n\nIn conclusion, through Santiago’s explorations of loneliness, Hemingway creates a deeply moving and realistic portrait of human life and the effects of loneliness, reminding us of the power of hope and perseverance. Furthermore, it demonstrates the power of companionship, which can provide necessary comfort in the face of hardship and loneliness. Therefore, despite Santiago’s struggles, he still performs his grueling journey with dignity, revealing Hemingway’s thoughtful exploration of the essential role of companionship in human life."},{"instruction":"Group the following ingredients into savory and sweet dishes.","input":"Egg, Olive Oil, Flour, Sugar","output":"Savory: Egg, Olive Oil, Flour\nSweet: Sugar"},{"instruction":"Explain how President Dwight D.
