It consists of four main stages which are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. \n\nIn prophase, the chromosomes condense and the nuclear membrane begins to break down. Microtubules attach to each chromosome at their centromeres in order to form the mitotic spindle. \n\nIn metaphase, the chromosomes line up along the equatorial plane in the middle of the spindle. \n\nIn anaphase, the microtubules attached to each chromatid pull on the sister chromatids in opposite directions. This results in the separation of the chromatids and the movement of the chromosomes to the opposite poles of the spindle. \n\nIn telophase, the chromosomes move to the poles of the spindle. The nuclear membrane reforms and the chromatids begin to relax and decondense. Ultimately, cytoplasm splits and the cell is divided into two daughter cells that are identical to the parent cell. \n\nMitosis is an essential process for cell growth and the survival of single-celled organisms. It is also essential for tissue and organ growth and repair."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What is the maximum speed limit in Arkansas?","input":"","output":"The maximum speed limit in Arkansas is 70 miles per hour."},{"instruction":"Translate the text from Spanish to English.","input":"Me gusta mucho hacer deportes","output":"I really like to do sports."},{"instruction":"Explain what a software engineer does.","input":"","output":"A software engineer is someone who designs, develops, tests, and maintains software products.
