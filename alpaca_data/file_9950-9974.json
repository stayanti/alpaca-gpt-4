Though the election was largely considered a referendum on the Presidency of Donald Trump, it was also notable for its implications for the future of the United States: an election that could determine the future of healthcare, immigration, climate change, and the rights of many communities.\n\nEarly polls had Joe Biden and Donald Trump in a virtual tie, yet on election night Biden had a substantial lead, soon enough becoming the projected winner of the election. Trump refused to accept these results, filing a number of lawsuits alleging that fraud had taken place, but the individual lawsuits did not successfully question the results.\n\nUltimately, Joe Biden won the election with 306 electoral votes while Donald Trump won 232. Biden also won the popular vote by a margin of more than 7 million votes. Biden's victory was seen as a repudiation of Trump, who became the first incumbent President to fail to win a second term since 1992. \n\nThe election showcased the political divide in the US, demonstrated by the divide between the popular vote and electoral vote. It also highlighted the different strategies deployed by the campaign teams, with Biden campaigning more digitally in light of the pandemic.\n\nThe 2020 US election will likely be remembered as one of the most important elections in history, one that saw an incumbent president questioning the results and fueling a culture of mistrust for democracy."}]
