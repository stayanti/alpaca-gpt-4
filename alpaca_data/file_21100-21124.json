Cats prefer to be solitary and independent while dogs thrive on being with people and prefer to be social. Cats like to sit on laps and be pet, but they lack the enthusiasm that dogs show when in need of affection. In addition, cats are often more active during nighttime and, depending on the breed, can climb up a tall tree or even jump up to a countertop. On the other hand, dogs offer some physical strength and can conform to a variety of commands. Moreover, cats are quieter than dogs and don’t require as much attention. Dogs on the other hand gain great pleasure out of pleasing their owners and will try to accommodate requests, especially when treats are involved. Despite the different characteristics between cats and dogs, they also share some similarities. Both require food, water, and regular vet visits. Both can express emotions and understanding towards their owners and both are devoted animals who won’t hesitate to protect their families when needed."},{"instruction":"Create an outline for a blog post about sexual harassment in the workplace.","input":"","output":"Outline for Blog Post about Sexual Harassment in the Workplace\n\nI.
