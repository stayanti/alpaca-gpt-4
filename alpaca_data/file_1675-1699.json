It is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere leading to an increase in global average temperatures, resulting in changes in climate patterns, sea levels, and extreme weather events. A majority of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases come from the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and other human activities that release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.\n\nFossil fuels are the biggest contributing factor to global warming. When these fuels are burned, their stored carbon is released as carbon dioxide and other pollutants, that trap heat in the atmosphere and increase the global temperature. This further leads to a vicious cycle where more carbon is released leading to further warming. Apart from long-term anthropogenic impacts, natural events such as volcanic eruptions and changes in the Earth's orbit can cause warming, but these processes take much longer and hence are not causes of current rapid global warming.\n\nThe effects of global warming are wide-reaching and can lead to severe changes in the climate across the world. For instance, increased temperatures can cause the polar ice caps to melt, leading to rising sea levels and inundating coastal regions. In addition, extreme weather conditions will become more common, resulting in deadly floods, droughts and other weather-related disasters. More worryingly, global warming may trigger abrupt and irreversible changes in the environment, with significant detrimental effects on the global climate, economy and human health. Therefore, more proactive measures need to be taken to reduce global carbon emissions in order to reduce the impact of global warming."}]
