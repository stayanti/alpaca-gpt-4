She was constantly busy running around and handling the animals, and it was starting to take its toll on her. She had just gotten off the bus and was walking home when she noticed a small tiger cub in a nearby alleyway. She cautiously approached and the cub made a playful meow.\n\nCarol felt a tug on her heartstrings. This must have been somebody's pet that had gotten lost. She bent down and picked the cub up, slowly petting its soft fur. The cub opened its eyes and looked intently at her. Carol thought for a moment, and decided to take the cub with her home.
