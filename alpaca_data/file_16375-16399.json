Cloud computing also allows users to leverage applications and storage without the need to purchase and maintain physical hardware."},{"instruction":"Provide an output to the following function","input":"def words_in_sentence(sentence):\n  sentence = sentence.lower()\n  words = sentence.split(\" \")\n  return len(words) \n\nInput sentence: \"This is a sample sentence\"","output":"4"},{"instruction":"Find the frequency of the word ‘the’ in a given text","input":"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog","output":"2"},{"instruction":"Create a SQL query to select all the customers records who have purchased more than 5 items","input":"","output":"SELECT * FROM customers WHERE number_of_purchases \u003e 5;"},{"instruction":"Describe the 4 fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming","input":"","output":"Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses abstractions to create models based on the real world. It employs four main principles: object orientation, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. Object orientation is the concept of organizing code around objects rather than functions and how they interact with each other. Polymorphism is the ability of classes to be extended and modified on-the-fly using inheritance and subclasses. Abstraction allows for the removal of unnecessary details from complex systems, allowing for a better focus on key processes. Encapsulation is the process of combining related data and functions into a single unit which can be manipulated as a single entity."},{"instruction":"How would you be monitoring and evaluating the performance of a GPT model?","input":"","output":"Performance monitoring and evaluation of a GPT model is typically done by measuring the accuracy of its output. This can be done by comparing the model's output against ground truth data, or by testing its performance on specific tasks designed for the model. Additionally, performance can be measured using metrics such as perplexity (the likelihood of correctly generating a sentence) and precision (the percentage of correctly generated sentences). Other methods of evaluation include human-based tests, such as annotator studies, which allow humans to evaluate the model's accuracy and how well it performs the intended task."},{"instruction":"Generate a story about a journey in space.","input":"","output":"It was a beautiful day on Earth, but Andrew was not content to stay on land.

Some of the most common pets are animals, ranging from furry mammals to funny reptiles and everything in between. Each pet animal has unique characteristics, abilities and needs, so it can be helpful to classify these animals into different types in order to make shopping and caring for them easier.\n\nThe first type of pet animal is mammals. This group includes cats, dogs, hamsters and rabbits, all of which are soft, cuddly and full of personality. Cats and dogs are particularly popular choices for pets due to their intelligence, affection and loyalty. When shopping for a pet mammal, it is important to consider the size of the home and level of activity a pet requires.\n\nAnother type of pet animal is reptiles, such as snakes, lizards, turtles and iguanas. These pets require special needs in terms of temperature and humidity levels, and generally must be kept in aquariums or tanks with heating lights. Reptiles are cool to look at and can live longer than other pet animals, but require more resources and attention than mammals.\n\nThe final type of pet animal is birds, including parrots, finches, canaries and more. These birds are ideal for people who prefer a lower-maintenance pet since they do not need to be taken out for long walks or bathed. On the other hand, birds require open cages with plenty of room to fly and play.\n\nIn conclusion, pets are beloved companions providing unconditional love and joy. There are three primary categories of pet animals—mammals, reptiles and birds—each of which has unique characteristics and needs. When choosing a pet animal, consider the size of the home, activity level, dietary needs and other requirements to ensure the animal gets the best care possible."},{"instruction":"Find an example of a metaphor in this sentence: My life is like a river flowing inexorably.","input":"","output":"The phrase \"my life is like a river flowing inexorably\" is an example of a metaphor.
