Text-based methods involve algorithms that compare sentences or sections of text to determine the degree of similarity between the two documents being compared. Graph-based methods involve algorithms that create a graphical representation of the text, such as a fingerprint or chart, and then compare the graphical representations of the documents to measure their similarity. In either method, if the similarity reaches a certain threshold, the algorithm will indicate that the documents have likely been plagiarized."},{"instruction":"Classify the following word as noun, verb, or other (other can refer to adjectives, adverbs, etc.)","input":"Well","output":"Other (Adverb)"},{"instruction":"Explain why human judgement is important in computer programming.","input":"","output":"Humans are necessary in numerous aspects of computer programming in order to ensure that the code is of sufficient quality for production.
