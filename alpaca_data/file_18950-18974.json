This means that each particle is instantaneously aware of what changes have been made to the other particle, even though they may be separated by vast distances. This happens without the transfer of information, and it is thought to be an aspect of quantum mechanics that is still not fully understood. In addition to describing two particles in a state of entanglement, the concept can be extended to apply to larger numbers of particles and even collections of particles. As such, quantum entanglement has become an important tool for researchers studying a variety of quantum phenomena."},{"instruction":"Given a dataframe of employee records, group the employees by age and gender.","input":"Employees DF:\nName | Age | Gender\nJohn | 35 | Male\nKendra | 25 | Female\nJared | 21 | Male\nRita | 32 | Female","output":"Group 1 (Male): John (35 years old), Jared (21 years old)\nGroup 2 (Female): Kendra (25 years old), Rita (32 years old)"},{"instruction":"Find the 8th term in the Fibonacci Sequence","input":"","output":"The 8th term in the Fibonacci Sequence is 21.
