Overfitting occurs when an AI algorithm is trained on too few data points, resulting in a model that performs well on the training data, but is not generalizable to new data. This can be caused by the model learning from noise instead of from the underlying patterns in the data. To combat overfitting, it is important to use a larger data set, expose the model to different types of data, and use regularization techniques such as dropout."},{"instruction":"Write a statement explaining why AI is important today.","input":"","output":"AI is an enabling technology that can transform how businesses operate and deliver value.
