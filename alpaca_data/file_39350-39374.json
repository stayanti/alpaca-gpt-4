In pre-training, the GPT model is trained with large unsupervised datasets on language modeling tasks.

During the fine-tuning phase, GPT models are adapted to specific domains by providing supervised datasets. This allows the GPT model to learn task-specific representations which further enhance the performance."},{"instruction":"Name five challenges associated with deploying GPT models in real-world applications.","input":"","output":"1.
