It is a circuit that has three possible states - high, low and high impedance or 'Z' state.\nThe high impedance state allows the tri-state logic signal to be connected to multiple devices sharing the same input or output line while not transferring data. Each bus line connected to the tri-state buffer can be driven 'high' or 'low', and when the tri-state buffer is in 'Z' state, none of the three other states is active, thus allowing the other devices to control the bus line."},{"instruction":"Name a public speaking technique.","input":"","output":"One public speaking technique to help engage listeners is the use of stories or anecdotes.
