It propagates through space, transferring energy from one location to another. The wave travels at the speed of light in a vacuum, which is roughly 3.00 x 10^8 meters per second. As it moves, the wave can be absorbed by objects or reflected back by them. When passing through matter, the wave can also be scattered by particles in the medium. This scattering can reduce the energy of the wave and thus the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation. It can also affect the frequency of the wave, resulting in a change in the color of the light. In general, electromagnetic waves can travel in a straight line or in curved paths, depending on the structure of the medium it is passing through."},{"instruction":"Summarize the differences between a debit and credit card","input":"","output":"Debit and credit cards are both payment methods with many similarities, but there are important differences between the two. Debit cards are linked to a checking account and allow you to make payments directly from your account balance.
