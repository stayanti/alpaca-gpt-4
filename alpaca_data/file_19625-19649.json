[{"instruction":"Write a persuasive essay on why public transportation should be used more.","input":"","output":"Public transportation is a crucial element of a sustainable world, and it should be used more often by all people. Using public transportation has multiple benefits, including reducing emissions, saving money, providing more job opportunities, and helping people stay healthy. In terms of emissions, public transportation reduces air pollution and reduces the amount of cars on the road. This reduces traffic and makes the air more breathable. In terms of cost, public transportation is often cheaper than driving. Taking the bus tends to be significantly more affordable than running a car, and it also eliminates the need to put gas in your car. Additionally, public transportation provides jobs, both in the form of drivers and in the form of maintenance and operations staff. Finally, using public transportation is a great way for people to get regular exercise without even thinking about it. By spending less time in a car and more time walking, the general population would become healthier. To conclude, because of the environmental and financial benefits, as well as the job and health opportunities, public transportation should be used more often."},{"instruction":"Come up with 10 questions related to nutrition.","input":"","output":"1.
