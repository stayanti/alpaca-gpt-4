Plastic pollution is a growing problem that affects not only our environment, but also our health. From our oceans to our landfills, plastic pollution is becoming increasingly pervasive and is destroying our planet. \n\nPlastic production involves many toxins which are hazardous to our environment and health. Studies have shown that long-term exposure to these toxins can lead to severe health problems. Additionally, plastic pollution is not biodegradable and takes years to break down.
