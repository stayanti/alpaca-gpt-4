This covers everything from structural integrity and air quality to natural light, size, noise level, and access to fresh air. Architects should consider habitability when they design buildings because it not only affects the quality of life for people living or working there, but also contributes to the overall aesthetic of the space. Good design also ensures that buildings are in line with regulations and built to last. Good habitability also encourages people to spend time in the space, since it is physically and psychologically conducive to doing so. In short, architects must factor in all the elements that create a comfortable and livable environment when designing a building."},{"instruction":"Find the time difference between the following two time points","input":"3:30pm June 26th, 2020 and 6:45pm June 30th, 2020","output":"The time difference between 3:30 pm June 26th, 2020 and 6:45 pm June 30th, 2020 is 4 days and 3 hours."},{"instruction":"Create a new implementation plan to reduce the price of transportation across the United States.","input":"","output":"An implementation plan to reduce the price of transportation across the United States should include the following measures.

In Canada, healthcare is provided as a basic human right and is covered by the government through public healthcare.

Additionally, Canada has a more unified system, with each province and territory having access to the same healthcare coverage, while the US has more variation across state governments and insurance companies. On the other hand, Canada's healthcare system has relatively less access to specialized care such as cancer treatments and neurosurgery, while the US has more specialized care options. Moreover, Americans have more freedom of choice in choosing their healthcare options, whereas Canadians must usually stick with the public system or pay out of pocket for private coverage."},{"instruction":"Describe what AI ethical best practices should organizations consider?","input":"","output":"Organizations should consider AI ethical best practices when using AI-powered tools.
