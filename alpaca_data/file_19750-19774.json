With relatively little cost and effort, data, materials, and even personnel can be exchanged between distant groups, across different time zones and cultures. This has opened opportunities for various industries as well as international collaborations—and is a major contributing factor to technological and economic development. \n\nThe Internet also allows people to quickly connect with others they otherwise would not have had access to. This connection makes it possible to connect with potential customers and business partners, allowing them to further their own enterprises. It also helps create a sense of community and socializing, even with individuals around the world. With the prevalence of social media, users can easily find, connect and communicate with groups of people with similar interests and goals. \n\nThe Internet has made both learning and entertainment much more accessible. More and more materials, such as e books, podcasts and MOOCs, are becoming available every day. Moreover, with the improved range of communication, it is now possible to join online gaming sites and tournaments with people from around the world without having to physically travel to the respective city or country.\n\nThe undeniably growing influence of the Internet in modern society is undeniable. The effects are far reaching and could not have been predicted at the outset of the development of the Internet. As the world adapts more and more to online activities, the positive and negative implications will continue to shape our lives as we experience numerous benefits from the use of the Internet."},{"instruction":"Create a website using HTML and CSS.","input":"","output":"\u003chtml\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eMy Website\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003clink rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"mystyle.css\"\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003ch1\u003eWelcome to My Website!\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003cp\u003eThis is a website I have created using HTML and CSS.\u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e"},{"instruction":"Describe the monetary policy of the Bank of England","input":"","output":"The Bank of England's monetary policy is focused on using council decisions and interest rates to ensure monetary (money supply) and financial stability, as well as to support economic growth. The primary tool is changing the base interest rate of the UK economy, which is the price of borrowing from the Bank of England. Lower interest rates stimulate the economy by encouraging banks to lend more to consumers and businesses, while higher interest rates slow demand by making borrowing more expensive. \n\nIn addition to setting interest rates, the Bank of England also implements a program of 'quantitative easing'. This is where the Bank creates new money to increase the total amount of money circulating in the economy. The new money encourages banks to lend more and also bolsters economic growth. By increasing the money supply, the Bank also aims to keep prices stable by controlling inflation.\n\nUltimately, the Bank of England's monetary policy is designed to keep the economy stable and growing. This is achieved by setting the appropriate level of interest rates and implementing various measures to ensure the money supply is not causing inflation."},{"instruction":"Explain the process of neural network training.","input":"","output":"Neural network training is a process which involves using an algorithm to iteratively and incrementally modify the weights of the connections between neurons in the network.
