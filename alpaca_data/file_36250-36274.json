Water can take the form of a liquid, solid or gas as it moves through the different stages of the cycle. The water cycle begins with evaporation, which is when the sun heats up the surface of water bodies, forcing liquid water to change state and vaporize into the air. The moisture in the air then turns into clouds and forms precipitation, such as snow, hail, and rain, which falls back to the surface of the Earth. Some of the water is absorbed into the ground and accumulates as groundwater, and the rest runs into rivers and streams, returning back to water bodies such as oceans, lakes, and reservoirs. The cycle continues as the water from these bodies heats up and evaporates again, starting the cycle anew."},{"instruction":"Design a table to store the information about floral sets.","input":"Floral Sets have 6 elements (Name, Image, Type, Colour of Flower, Occasion and Price).","output":"Table: Floral Sets\n\nColumns: \nName | Image | Type | Colour of Flower | Occasion | Price\n-----|-------|------|------------------|----------|------"},{"instruction":"Analyse the given tweet and categorize it into the corresponding emotion class.","input":"I'm super excited for tomorrow!","output":"Emotion class: Joy"},{"instruction":"Find the gross profit of an item after taxation given its cost price and selling price.","input":"Cost price: 50\nSelling price: 100","output":"Gross profit = 50, after taxation."},{"instruction":"List five tropical fruits.","input":"","output":"Mangoes, pineapples, papayas, coconuts, dragon fruit."},{"instruction":"Categorize the following list into different genres","input":"Harry Potter, Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Rings","output":"Fantasy: Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings; Realistic fiction: Catcher in the Rye"},{"instruction":"Describe a prototypical website page","input":"","output":"A prototypical website page typically contains a navigation bar, a hero section with a banner image and headline, several information sections, and sometimes a footer."},{"instruction":"List the four major functions of an operating system","input":"","output":"The four major functions of an operating system are managing hardware and software resources, acting as a user interface, providing networking services, and controlling input and output."},{"instruction":"Explain why it is important to manage your online privacy.","input":"","output":"It is important to manage your online privacy because it helps protect your personal information from being accessed and shared by unauthorized parties.
