This means that an object's speed, its position in space, and even its mass can affect the passage of time. Einstein also proposed that gravity is the result of the curvature of spacetime, which means that gravity can be thought of as a bend in the fabric of the universe. Ultimately, the Theory of Relativity explains the behavior of the universe on a large scale and has been used to confirm numerous modern scientific discoveries."},{"instruction":"Give an example of how climate change is affecting human health.","input":"","output":"Climate change is negatively affecting human health in a variety of ways.
