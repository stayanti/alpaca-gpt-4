[{"instruction":"Compose a 200-word article about the effects of global warming on extreme weather events.","input":"","output":"Climate change is having a dramatic impact on extreme weather events across the globe. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events has risen significantly over the past few decades, with higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and changes in rainfall patterns contributing to a greater likelihood of extreme weather events. \n\nThese extreme events include increased hurricanes, floods and storms, heat waves, and other natural disasters. Hurricanes, for example, are becoming increasingly common and more intense due to higher sea surface temperatures, increased evaporation, and higher air temperatures. These impacts are felt in the form of more costly and destructive hurricanes, causing more damage and claiming more lives. \n\nFloods, too, pose an ever-increasing danger. Rising sea levels put coastal regions at risk for more destructive floods, and heavier and more frequent rainfalls add to the risk of flooding in already vulnerable areas. In 2018, for example, record-breaking rains in the Midwest resulted in widespread flooding that cost billions of dollars in damages and claimed many lives. \n\nBut the effects of climate change are not limited to floods and storms. Heat waves are becoming more frequent and more intense, resulting in droughts, crop failures, and massive economic losses due to infrastructure damage. Further, changes in weather patterns can disrupt migration patterns resulting in an increase in human-animal conflicts. \n\nIn addition to the direct fatalities and damage caused by these extreme events, climate change has also caused numerous other long-term impacts on the environment and economy, such as degrading air quality, resulting in respiratory illnesses, soil depletion, and economic instability. Given these issues, it is clear that reducing the global impact of climate change must be a priority."},{"instruction":"Provide a meaning of the term \"Machine Learning\".","input":"","output":"Machine Learning is the ability of a machine to use data to improve itself, by taking various kinds of data as input and continually updating its understanding as it receives new data.

This approach is often used to improve the model's accuracy without relying on large datasets and expensive manual labeling.\n\nActive learning uses an iterative cycle: the AI system first selects the best data samples to train on, and then uses those data samples to update its understanding of the underlying patterns and trends. This process allows the system to better understand the relationships between the different inputs and outputs, and leads to improved model accuracy."},{"instruction":"Generate a list of four US cities with over one million population.","input":"","output":"New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston."},{"instruction":"Provide two examples of supervised and two examples of unsupervised machine learning.","input":"","output":"Supervised ML: Regression, Classification\nUnsupervised ML: Clustering, Anomaly Detection"},{"instruction":"Provide the definition of \"software architecture\"","input":"","output":"Software architecture is the structures of systems and the discipline of creating such structures and systems.

The method assumes that the particles behavior is driven by simple equations of motion, making it different from the classical ray tracing method which did not consider the motion of the particles. KRT starts by calculating the physical parameters at each particle position and then releasing a set of rays from the view point of the observer that are propagated through the particles trajectories. As the rays move between the particles positions, their parameters are updated accordingly, and at the end of the calculations, the collected information is rendered according to the observers viewpoint."},{"instruction":"A debate team needs to decide on a stance for their debate.
