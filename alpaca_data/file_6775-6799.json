AI is driving the transformation of industries, creating new opportunities and reshaping the way businesses and individuals interact with technology. While the development of AI has the potential to improve our lives and make us more efficient, there are also dangers associated with its increasingly dominant presence.\n\nOne of the greatest dangers posed by the rise of AI is the potential for technology to replace human roles. We’ve already seen this occurring in blue-collar jobs, where robots and automated systems have replaced traditional manual labor. As AI technology continues to evolve and become more sophisticated, white-collar roles will also be subject to replacement. This could cause significant disruption to labor markets and lead to significant job losses.\n\nAnother potential hazard associated with AI is the potential for technology to be used inappropriately or maliciously. As automation and AI become increasingly powerful, they will be vulnerable to malicious cyber actors and could be used to carry out identity theft, financial theft, and other cybercrimes. Similarly, AI technologies can be vulnerable to algorithmic bias, where decisions being made based on AI-trained data sets can lead to disparities in outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, AI technology has the potential to dramatically improve our lives, but also carries significant risks that must be addressed if it is to be taken advantage of safely and securely."},{"instruction":"Can you summarize the given description/paragraph?","input":"Rockets are spacecrafts that are propelled by rocket engines and are used to go to outer space.

Firstly, brick and mortar stores must factor in the cost of staffing and maintaining the storefront, which adds to the price of the goods they sell. Secondly, they must consider the cost of pay rent and utilities, which also adds to the overall cost. Thirdly, they must factor in the cost of transporting goods to the store, as well as potential losses due to product expiry. Finally, stores must also factor in their profit margin when setting their prices. \n\nIn comparison, online stores do not need to factor in these costs when setting their prices. They are typically more efficient when transporting goods, as well as having access to larger warehouses where products can be stored for longer periods of time, reducing the chances of product expiry. They also do not need to pay rent or utilities, which reduces the cost of their goods. Therefore, this difference in overhead costs allows online stores to offer their goods at cheaper prices compared to brick and mortar stores."}]
