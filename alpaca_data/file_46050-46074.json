She was the odd one out, smaller and quieter than the raucous and vibrant bugs around her. Clinging to a jade-green leaf, the mantis seemed insignificant, until her beady, black eyes caught the sunlight.\n\nThe Praying Mantis was a colorful creature, cloaked in delicate emerald wings, and an armor made from carmine and umber hues, with flashes of cobalt and ivory. Her antennae had a telltale shape that marked her species as an expert hunter, and her stance alone conveyed her purpose in life: to protect the fragile and unsteady, even at the cost of her own well-being.\n\nOn the heated jungle floor, the mantis lay in wait for her future prey. She was patient and alert, yet, the anticipation and loneliness she often felt was only a temporary haven from the dreadfulness of the real world. She was content in this quietude, honing her instincts, while her fears lay dormant in the darkness.\n\nSlowly, the mantis spread her arms wide. Her barbed feet were firmly planted and her gaze, determined. Her head swayed back and forth with the rhythm of a metronome. Time seemed to pass with an unbearable speed; however, the Praying Mantis was oblivious, preparing herself in stoic silence. \n\nIn an instant, the mantis jumped forward to snatch her unsuspecting prey, a fly. At an almost unbelievable speed, the mantis had caught it before the fly could even flutter a wing. The mantis had won, and the beautiful wings slowly folded as she scurried away with her quarry securely tucked in her claws.\n\nThe Praying Mantis had gained her dues and silence reigned in the hot jungle. The mantis had taken flight and vanished, her mysterious presence still lingering in the moist air."},{"instruction":"Describe a boat in 3 paragraphs.","input":"","output":"The boat I am describing is a classic wooden sailing boat, with a sail of bright white canvas billowing in the cool sea breeze.
