Plant-based diets emphasize whole foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes that are rich in vitamins, minerals and fiber and are low in saturated fat. Plant-based diets are naturally low in cholesterol and saturated fat, and are associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and other chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. Additionally, plant-based diets are a more sustainable way to meet dietary needs as they require less land, water, and other resources to produce. \n\nIn contrast, animal-based diets are typically higher in cholesterol, saturated fat, and total calorie intake. There is also evidence that eating meat is linked with an increased risk in certain diseases such as heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer. Animal-based diets also require more land, water and other resources to produce. \n\nOverall, a plant-based diet is better for overall health and has a much lower environmental impact than an animal-based diet."},{"instruction":"Assemble a toy robot according to the given instructions.","input":"Instructions: Tip: Make sure to read the instructions and familiarize yourself with all the pieces before beginning.\n\n\u003cnoinput\u003e","output":"Step 1: Begin by inserting the two wires into the back of the robot’s head, checking to make sure the connections are secure.\n\nStep 2: Attach the torso plate to the back of the head plate.
