Caring for your skin helps you avoid issues like premature aging, acne, hyperpigmentation, and more. To help keep your skin looking its best, here are five helpful tips for skin care:\n\n1. Use the Right Cleanser. It is important to use a gentle cleanser that is free from harsh chemicals and fragrances. Look for one that fits your skin type—oily, combination, or dry—to help you keep your skin healthy and clear. \n\n2. Don’t Skip the Moisturizer. Moisturizers are key for any skin type, as they help seal in the moisture and give you a smooth complexion. An anty-aging formula can also reduce the appearance of wrinkles.\n\n3. Use Sunscreen. Sunscreen helps protect your skin from the sun’s rays and reduces the risk of sunburns and skin cancer. Make sure to wear it year-round and reapply every two hours when you’re spending time outside.\n\n4. Protect Your Lips. Your lips don’t have the same oil glands that your skin does, so it’s essential to make sure they’re getting the moisture they need. Carry a lip balm with SPF to help protect them from UVA and UVB rays.\n\n5. Get Enough Sleep. Lack of sleep can have a negative effect on your skin. Make sure you’re getting a good night’s sleep and waking up at the same time each day. This will help give you some of the best skin of your life. \n\nWith these tips in mind, you can keep your skin looking and feeling its best. Make sure you’re protecting yourself with sunscreen and getting enough sleep each day to keep your skin healthy and nourished. Talk to your doctor if you’re on medications or are concerned about any skin issues."},{"instruction":"Order the following list based on increasing complexity: basic, complex, intermediate.","input":"","output":"Basic, Intermediate, Complex."}]
