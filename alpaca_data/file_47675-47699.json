This process is called fission, and it is typically initiated by a neutron, which splits the nucleus of the atom and releases more neutrons, which can then go on to fission more nuclei in a chain reaction. This chain reaction is what powers nuclear reactors, and can also be used as a weapon when harnessed in a critical mass."},{"instruction":"Provide three examples of common natural disasters.","input":"","output":"Common natural disasters include floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes."},{"instruction":"What does an embedding layer do in a neural network?","input":"","output":"An embedding layer in a neural network is used to learn a dense low dimensional representation of a sparse high dimensional input. This allows the representation of categorical data such as words, phrases, etc. to become a part of a neural network and be used in making predictions. Embeddings also allow we to reduce the dimensionality of the problem, which can speed up training and improve the model's performance."},{"instruction":"Name three Asian cities with iconic skylines.","input":"","output":"Three Asian cities with iconic skylines are Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Tokyo."},{"instruction":"Generate a list of 5 animals native to Europe.","input":"","output":"1.

Early video games used rudimentary designs, often borrowing elements from traditional board games, and were mainly available as arcade machines. Over time, game design has evolved to include more intricate plots and graphical styles, with the development of computer and console technology. Through the decades, game designers have continued to innovate and create new experiences, from the \"sandbox\" style of open-world games to the phenomenon of esports. As technology continues to improve, game design will remain an important part of the entertainment industry."},{"instruction":"Provide an example of a complex system that consists of several interacting components.","input":"","output":"A human body is a complex system that consists of several interacting components. The body contains multiple organ systems that work together to carry out vital functions, such as respiration, digestion, circulation, and reproduction.
