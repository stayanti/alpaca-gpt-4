[{"instruction":"Summarize a scientific article about global warming in 5 sentences or less.","input":"The article: 'Global Warming: Causes and Consequences'","output":"Global warming is caused by the increase of certain gases in our atmosphere that trap heat. These gases are typically released as a result of human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. This heat trapping leads to climate change and the resulting weather extremes, the risk of extreme storms, and rising sea levels. There are several solutions to global warming, such as emissions reduction and increased use of renewable energy sources, that can mitigate these consequences."},{"instruction":"Come up with an appropriate slogan for a new cereal brand.","input":"","output":"Cereal for a smarter morning!"},{"instruction":"Convert the below sentence into plural.","input":"She has a dog.","output":"She has dogs."},{"instruction":"Tune the rhythm of the song.","input":"","output":"\u003cnooutput\u003e"},{"instruction":"Come up with an analogy to describe a mobile phone.","input":"","output":"A mobile phone is like a Swiss Army knife; it has everything you need when you need it."},{"instruction":"Name an animal that can fly.","input":"","output":"Birds, bats, and insects are all animals that can fly."},{"instruction":"What is the air speed velocity of an unladen swallow?","input":"","output":"The air speed velocity of an unladen swallow is around 24 miles per hour."},{"instruction":"Explain the concept of interest rate.","input":"","output":"An interest rate is the amount charged by a lender for the use of its money. It is typically expressed as a percentage and is based on the amount of money borrowed, length of the loan and the risk of default. When you borrow money from a lender, you will be obligated to pay back the total amount borrowed plus interest over the term of the loan; the interest rate determines how much of the total payment is comprised of interest. Interest is a way for lenders to make a profit and can be used as an incentive for borrowers to choose a particular lender."},{"instruction":"Name three things a bee does.","input":"","output":"Bees are important pollinators and play an important role in the ecosystem.

He had never seen a place like this before and he was quite taken aback. After a few moments of shock, the alien began to move slowly and cautiously through the vast trees, eventually emerging into a clearing with a distant city lit up in the night sky. He slowly made his way to the city and as he did, he got the feeling that something incredible was about to happen.\n\nThe alien eventually arrived at a small park in the middle of the city, and as he entered he felt a presence nearby. He looked around and noticed an elderly man and woman sitting on a bench, and they were staring directly at him. The alien slowly approached them and spoke, introducing himself along with the reason for his visit. The couple seemed to understand and accepted him as one of their own.\n\nThe alien slowly settled into his new life on Earth and eventually even began to fit in with the locals. As time passed, the alien began to fully understand the way of life on Earth and even embraced it, becoming an integral part of the community. His tale of arriving on Earth became legend and a testament to the fact that no matter where we come from, we are all part of the same world."},{"instruction":"Comment on the following statement: \"Schools should be closed in winter breaks.\"","input":"","output":"Schools should take into consideration closing during winter breaks if necessary to prioritize the safety of students and staff.

The moon orbits the Earth every 27.3 days, sometimes in the same position but sometimes at a slightly different angle. As it orbits, the amount of moonlight visible to us on Earth increases or decreases. Additionally, what phase of moon we can see—whether it is a full moon, waning moon, waxing moon, or new moon—will also depend on its position."},{"instruction":"Calculate the population growth rate of Brazil in the last decade.","input":"","output":"The population growth rate in Brazil in the last decade was 1.39%."},{"instruction":"Come up with five ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.","input":"","output":"Five ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions include: \n1.
