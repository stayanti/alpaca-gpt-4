Augmented reality typically uses cameras, sensors, and technologies such as machine learning, robotic process automation, and natural language processing to detect objects in the real-world and deliver an interactive virtual experience. By capturing the user's environment, the application can generate a simulated environment to enable real-time interactions with the user. The system then responds to the user's input and updates the content accordingly, creating a truly immersive and interactive experience."},{"instruction":"Write the method for finding the area of a circle.","input":"","output":"def area_of_circle(radius): \n    \"\"\" Computes the area of a circle with given radius. \n      \n    Args: \n        radius (float): The radius of the circle \n      \n    Returns: \n        float: The calculated area of the circle \n    \"\"\"\n    area = 3.14 * (radius**2) \n    return area"},{"instruction":"Generate at least two example sentences using the verb \"incite\".","input":"","output":"The politician sought to incite the crowd with her inflammatory speech. \\\\\nThe protesters were incited to march to the city hall by the speech."},{"instruction":"Identify the correct grammatical tense for the sentence \"She is a singer.\"","input":"","output":"Present simple."},{"instruction":"Create a function, \"factorial_of(),\" that takes in an integer and returns its factorial.","input":"","output":"def factorial_of(n):\n    \"\"\"This function takes in a integer 'n' and returns its factorial.\n    \n    Args: \n        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of\n      \n    Returns: \n        int: The calculated factorial of 'n'\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial_of(n-1)"},{"instruction":"Name two benefits of using a computer to create a program.","input":"","output":"One benefit is that computers are able to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately.

Deep learning models use networks of neural nodes and layers to learn from large sets of data and then output better predictions than traditional machine learning models. Deep learning models are more powerful because they can learn from recognizing patterns and correlations instead of merely identifying individual features."},{"instruction":"Delete the third sentence of a given text.","input":"The hotel was a chic, modern design.
