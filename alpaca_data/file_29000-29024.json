This acceleration is known as the gravitational acceleration of a falling object, called \"g\", which is 9.8 m/s^2. The rock starts from rest, meaning it has an initial speed of 0 m/s. Thus, its velocity increases with time, meaning the rock will move faster the longer it is in the air. The rock will eventually reach its terminal velocity - the maximum velocity it can reach - which is reached after reaching a certain amount of air resistance. At this point, the rock will continually maintain the same velocity until it hits the ground."},{"instruction":"Write a persuasive essay on whether online classes are effective.","input":"","output":"Online classes have revolutionized the way of learning and teaching. In the Covid-19 pandemic, they have allowed teaching and learning to continue despite the imposed physical restrictions. But do online classes really have the same efficacy as traditional in-person instruction? This essay will argue that despite being highly convenient, online classes fail to provide the depth and quality of instruction as would be provided if instruction was conducted in person. \n\nOne major problem with online classes is the lack of in-person interaction between students and instructors. Offline classes are highly beneficial in that instructors are able to guide students through their work, answer any questions, and catch any mistakes. Without physical presence, students can struggle to understand their work and don't have access to any support from their instructor. Moreover, in classes such as lab sciences, online students don't have access to the practical demonstrations and thus, fully understand the lab material. Furthermore, students who take online classes are more likely to be more distant from the subject matter and may tend to procrastinate and be less attentive in class, almost completely mitigating any advantage of the class being online instead of in person. \n\nIn conclusion, online classes have come as a handy tool to continue teaching during times of crisis. But they still fail to provide the necessary depth and quality of instruction as compared to traditional in-person ones. The lack of physical presence of instructors and students and lack of in-person access to demonstrations both have a negative effect on online classes' efficacy, thus making them less effective as compared to in-person classes."},{"instruction":"Suggest three activities for a group of 8-10 year old children at an outdoor party.","input":"","output":"For a group of 8-10 year old children at an outdoor party, a few suitable activities could be: \n- A scavenger hunt, where the children have to find different items hidden around the party area. \n- A limbo competition, where the participants have to see who can go the lowest without touching the stick. \n- A relay race, where the children can be split up into teams and compete against each other in a fun and active game."},{"instruction":"Categorize the following emotions: joy, confusion, sadness.","input":"","output":"The following emotions can be categorized as follows: \n- Joy - Positive emotion\n- Confusion - Neutral emotion\n- Sadness - Negative emotion"},{"instruction":"Compare the concept of a 'market' with the concept of a 'mall'.","input":"","output":"A market and a mall are quite different concepts.

Each strand is made up of phosphate groups and the four nitrogenous bases: guanine (G), adenine (A), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Each base is connected to a sugar molecule, making up the sugar-phosphate backbone of a DNA strand. The strands are linked together by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases: A-T, G-C, forming base pairs. These base pairs form the \"rungs\" of the DNA ladder, with a complete ladder representing one turn of the double helix structure."},{"instruction":"Find the density of a substance given its mass and volume.","input":"Mass: 10 kg\nVolume: 8 L","output":"The density of the substance is 1.25 kg/L.
