Structural functionalism is a sociological theory that explains how social structures and social functions are bound together. Its premise is that society is composed of systems that interact to maintain stability. Symbolic interactionism is a theory that focuses on understanding how individuals interact and how meaning is created in interactions. It states that language and symbols are used to define reality, and that when people interact, they interpret these symbols to reach shared meanings. Conflict theory is a theory that views society as divided into different groups, which are in conflict with each other to gain resources, power, and status. It explains that the power and resources in society are unevenly distributed leading to an unequal balance of power among groups. Social change is propelled when groups with unequal power engage in conflict and strive for an equilibrium of power. \n\nThese three theories provide a foundation for understanding human behavior in a social context. Structural functionalism explains the interaction between individuals and their roles in a larger institution, symbolic interactionism focuses on understanding the meanings created in social interaction, and conflict theory views society as polarized with power struggles. By understanding these theories, we can further understand the complex dynamics of our social world."},{"instruction":"Take the given proverb and twist it.","input":"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush","output":"One in the hand is worth more than two that you rush."},{"instruction":"Take the same topic but change the tone of the text.","input":"Topic: The state of emergency","output":"The state of emergency has been declared, and it's an exciting time of change.
