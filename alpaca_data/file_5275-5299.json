Then, the quicksort algorithm is invoked recursively on both the sub-arrays, until there are no more elements to be sorted. Finally, the two sorted sub-arrays are merged, resulting in a fully sorted array."},{"instruction":"From the following poem, provide a summary of the last two lines.","input":"The waves would leap up to the sun\nAnd tell of our joy and fun","output":"The waves expressed the joy and fun that was had in the sun."},{"instruction":"Output the result of the following boolean operation.","input":"True or False","output":"True"},{"instruction":"From the following list, select the items which are examples of unstructured data.","input":"images, audio clips, tweets, spreadsheets","output":"images, audio clips, tweets."},{"instruction":"Summarize the main idea of the following article in one sentence.","input":"The question of when self-driving cars will be available on the market has been up for debate.
