Online education makes educational opportunities more widely available as it does not require students to be in the same physical location as the instructor, thus allowing them to take classes from anywhere in the world. Additionally, online education is often less expensive than traditional forms of education, as it eliminates many of the costs associated with traditional classroom settings, such as physical textbooks and classroom materials.\n\nThe most commonly cited argument against online education is the potential for decreased student engagement and academic performance. For instance, without an instructor or peers present in the same physical space, it can be difficult for students to stay motivated and engaged in the course material. Additionally, the lack of real-time interaction, such as in-class discussions and real-time feedback, can make it difficult to understand complex concepts and can lead to lower learning outcomes. \n\nOverall, while online education has the potential to be more accessible and affordable, there is also a risk that student engagement and academic performance could potentially suffer. Therefore, it is important to take into consideration both the potential benefits and drawbacks of online education when making decisions about its use."},{"instruction":"Brainstorm three open-ended questions about the given article.","input":"The article is about the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare.","output":"1.
