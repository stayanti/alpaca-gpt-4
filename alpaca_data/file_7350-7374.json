It was a powerful creature with gnarled horns and a wicked glint in its eye. It had been living in the darkness for many years, and its cold heart had grown as dark and empty as the cave itself.\n\nOne day, the monster heard a noise coming from an unexpected corner of the cave. At first, it was slight, a mere whisper, but then it grew louder. Peering into the darkness, the monster saw a small light bobbing closer and closer. Finally, the source of the light stepped forward, and the monster gasped – it was a human child!\n\nThe child was weary and scared, but they were also brave, and they began to tell the monster their story. They spoke of a magical land that was filled with light and beauty, how they had been on a quest to find a crystal that could save their world, but stumbled into the dark cave instead.\n\nThe monster was surprised by the child's courage, but even more so by their kindness. It had never encountered such emotions in the dark cave, and the monster's once-shriveled heart grew a little warmer. \n\nThe monster offered to help the child on their journey. Together they ventured to the far reaches of the cave, eventually emerging into the beautiful light of the child's magical land. The child thanked the monster, who in turn thanked the child for bringing new life and light into the darkness.\n\nWith a final goodbye, the monster said that it would never forget the kindness the child had shown them and returned deep into the dark cave. It had learned there was beauty and light, even in the darkest of places."},{"instruction":"Create a photo caption for the photo given.","input":"John on a beach [photo of John on a beach]","output":"John enjoying a beautiful day at the beach, with his toes in the sand and the sun on his face."},{"instruction":"Find 4 interesting facts about the topic.","input":"Birds","output":"1.
