When launched, the paper airplane utilizes four forces of flight - lift, drag, thrust and weight - in order to fly. Lift is generated by differences in air pressure as the air flows over the wings, while drag is created when the viscous air particles in the atmosphere affect the airflow around the wings. Thrust is created by the momentum of the paper airplane when thrown and weight is the force of gravity pulling the object towards the ground. These four forces of flight work in harmony to allow the paper airplane to complete its desired flight path."},{"instruction":"Write a few lines of an original poem.","input":"","output":"I wish upon the stars at night,\nTo make all my dreams come true.\nWith each fleeting moment, I keep calling,\nThat answer I'm still pursuing."},{"instruction":"Cut the following shape out of a piece of paper.","input":"+---+\n|   |\n| A |\n|   |\n+---+","output":"\u003cnoinput\u003e"},{"instruction":"Generate a simple metaphor to explain the sun.","input":"","output":"The sun is like a lighthouse in the sky, lighting the way for those below."},{"instruction":"Analyze the given text and provide a list of prominent themes.","input":"The sky was filled with stars, and the clouds drifted by like gentle waves on a still night.","output":"Prominent themes in the text include beauty of nature, stillness, movement, and the vastness of the night sky."},{"instruction":"Create the heading for a news article about the impact of climate change.","input":"","output":"Climate Change: Uncovering the Alarming Effects"},{"instruction":"Add an appropriate transitional phrase to connect the following two sentences.","input":"I could not finish the project on time.
