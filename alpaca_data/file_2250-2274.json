The output voltage is inversely proportional to the relative resistance in the circuit. The principle of the divider circuit is that the total resistance of the interconnected resistors is equal to the sum of the individual resistances. Thus, the output voltage of the circuit will be divided among the resistors, with the highest resistance receiving the highest voltage and the lowest resistance receiving the lowest voltage."},{"instruction":"Train a natural language model to predict the next word given a context.","input":"","output":"Creating a Natural Language Model for predicting the next word given a context involves a few stages:\n\n1.
