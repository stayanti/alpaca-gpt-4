To bisect a line segment, you need two points on the line segment, A and B. Draw a line perpendicular to the line segment at point A and extend it through point B. This is the line that will represent the bisector of the line segment. Draw a circle using point A as the center and a radius of half of the line segment, this will intersect the perpendicular line at a midpoint, C. Lastly, draw a line from point A to point C and from point B to point C. This will create two equal line segments, each with the same length bisected by the perpendicular line."},{"instruction":"Solve the following mathematical equation: 5(x-7)= 2x + 4","input":"","output":"The solution to the equation 5(x-7) = 2x + 4 is x = 9."},{"instruction":"Summarize the following article:\n\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/tennessee/great-smoky-mountains-national-park/","input":"","output":"Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a stunning natural preserve in the southeastern United States.
