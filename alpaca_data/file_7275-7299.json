This is because machine learning utilizes techniques such as pattern recognition, data mining, deep learning, natural language processing, and other techniques to recognize patterns and extract meaning from large amounts of data. This allows machine learning algorithms to be trained on only a few examples, which can then be used to make predictions and decisions without the need for additional programming or manual coding. This is a great advantage over traditional programming, which often requires a lot of effort and manual coding to achieve the same results. Additionally, machine learning algorithms are able to adjust themselves and \"learn\" from new data, whereas traditional programming requires all the code to be manually updated and adapted for new data sets."},{"instruction":"Think of a way to make a boring task more enjoyable.","input":"Filing paperwork.","output":"Filing paperwork can be made more enjoyable by creating a game out of the process.
