My father had given me my first stamp collection and I soon became obsessed with the variety of colors, designs and stories that each stamp contained. I started to research the histories and stories of each stamp in order to find out more information and uncover secrets behind them. I slowly expanded my collection, always on the hunt for unique and hard to find stamps. I felt proud when I was able to find one that I was missing from my collection from a far away place.

As temperatures and weather patterns become increasingly unpredictable, wildlife is struggling to adapt to and survive in a rapidly changing environment. From increasing floods and droughts, to the introduction of new species, climate change continues to have a devastating impact on the biodiversity of entire species across all environments.\n\nThe issues presented by climate change have been felt by a diverse array of species. Polar bears have been among the most vulnerable, as their icy habitats, which are essential for hunting and sleeping, continue to melt and shrink. Other species, such as coral, are becoming increasingly susceptible to rising ocean temperatures, leading to a form of “bleaching”, which can devastate entire reefs and ecosystems.   Sea levels continue to rise, while fragile aquatic habitats experience increasingly acidic waters, both which can cause immeasurable damage to delicate marine species.\n\nIn terrestrial habitats, increasing temperatures and extreme weather events are forcing animals to migrate to find more suitable habitats. As habitats shrink and become more fragmented, some species are struggling to survive due to a lack of resources and suitable nesting ground. Changes in temperature can also cause disruption to the reproductive cycles of species, leading to decreased or non-existent breeding.\n\nClimate change continues to have a tremendous impact on the population of vulnerable species around the world, and it is important to understand its implications for the long-term wellbeing of wildlife. By gaining an understanding of the effects of climate change, conservation groups and citizens can work to identify and protect habitats that may be impacted by changes in weather and temperature. In addition, changes in public policy and laws can help reduce the spread and intensity of climate change, giving wildlife a better chance of adapting and surviving in a rapidly changing world."},{"instruction":"Write a Python program that will calculate the total cost of a meal given the ingredients and their cost.","input":"Lettuce (3 oz): $1.50;\nTomatoes (2 pcs): $0.50;\nOnion (1 pc): $0.20;\nGarlic (2 cloves): $0.05","output":"ingredient_cost = [1.5, 0.5, 0.2, 0.05]\ntotal_cost = 0\n\nfor cost in ingredient_cost:\n    total_cost += cost\n\nprint(total_ cost)\n# 2.25"},{"instruction":"Generate recipes for a vegan lasagna.","input":"","output":"Vegan Lasagna Recipe:\nIngredients:\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- 1/2 medium onion, diced\n- 3 cloves garlic, minced\n- 8-ounce package vegan sausage, crumbled\n- 28-ounce can diced tomatoes\n- 2 tablespoons tomato paste\n- 2 teaspoon Italian seasoning\n- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste\n- 12 ounces vegan lasagna noodles\n- 15-ounce can cooked chickpeas, drained and rinsed\n- 2 cups baby spinach, torn\n- 15-ounce package vegan ricotta cheese\n- 4 ounces vegan mozzarella cheese, shredded\n- 2 tablespoons freshly grated vegan Parmesan cheese\n\nInstructions:\n1.
