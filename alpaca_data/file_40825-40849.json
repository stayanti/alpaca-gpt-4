As the figure stepped out of the mist, they saw that it was a human wearing an exquisite set of armor.\n\nThe figure introduced itself as King Emeric, the ruler of the kingdom of Rellinor, which had been swallowed up by the mist. He told the five creatures that in order to save the kingdom and restore balance to the land, they had to work together and help him find the five Mystical Keys. He said that when all of the keys were found, a powerful spell would be unlocked and the mist would be destroyed.\n\nThe creatures agreed to help and set off on a journey to find the five keys.
