This would be followed by another short burst of sudden change and then another period of stability. This theory states that the long periods of stability are the result of the equilibrium being created between two opposing forces of genotypic and phenotypic variation. This explains the absence of intermediate forms in the fossil record, as the large adjustments observed over time occur in relatively short bursts followed by far longer periods without change."},{"instruction":"Explain why electric cars are better than their petrol/diesel counterparts.","input":"","output":"electric cars are better than their petrol/diesel counterparts because they are more efficient, cost less to maintain, and produce zero emissions, making them a much more environmentally friendly option.

The refrigerant is then sent to the compressor, where it is compressed, raising the temperature and turning it into a hot gas. The hot gas then goes to the condenser, where it releases its heat to the outside environment and is cooled back down into liquid form. The liquid refrigerant is then sent back to the evaporator, completing the cycle."},{"instruction":"Create a persuasive argument in favor of reading books.","input":"","output":"Reading books has many advantages that make it a worthwhile past time for everyone.
