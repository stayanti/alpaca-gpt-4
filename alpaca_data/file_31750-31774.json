Common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, and selection sort. Bubble sort works by repeatedly going through the array, comparing pairs of elements, and swapping them if they are out of order; this continues until the array is sorted. Merge sort divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each of these halves, and then merges them back together; the final result is a sorted array. Quick sort works by selecting an element as a pivot, then partitioning the array into smaller sub-arrays based on the position of the element relative to the pivot; the sub-arrays are then recursively sorted and merged. Finally, selection sort works by selecting the smallest element in the array, swapping it with the element in the first position, selecting the next smallest element and swapping it with the element in the second position, and continuing until the array is sorted."},{"instruction":"What is URL shortening?","input":"","output":"URL shortening is a technique used to create shorter versions of web addresses, making them easier to remember or share.
