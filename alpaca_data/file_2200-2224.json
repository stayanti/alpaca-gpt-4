Energy efficient appliances use less energy per use than their inefficient counterparts, so they save on energy costs when used regularly. Solar energy is a renewable source of energy, so the energy used is not depleting any finite resources. This form of energy production is also more environmentally friendly than other forms, such as those that rely on burning fossil fuels. Additionally, it does not produce any pollutants and does not require much maintenance. Both of these methods are particularly effective for households looking for convenient and cost-effective means to save energy."},{"instruction":"Compile a list of five major problems that cause climate change.","input":"","output":"The five major problems that cause climate change are burning fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, industrial agriculture, animal agriculture, and air pollution. Burning fossil fuels releases large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and leading to global warming. Deforestation destroys habitats and reduces the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed, leading to greenhouse gas build-up. Industrial and animal agriculture are responsible for releasing large amounts of methane and nitrous oxide into the atmosphere.
