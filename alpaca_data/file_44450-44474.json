The Neural Network module is responsible for learning user behavior and preferences. It does this by analyzing user input, training on models, and making predictions based on past behavior. Finally, the AI-controlled agent is responsible for executing tasks that the user requests. It interfaces with the other two modules, taking in user input and acting on it.
