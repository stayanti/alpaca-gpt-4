Natural language processing involves understanding the structure, meaning and function of spoken sentences to form automatic responses or actions. GPT can be used to develop natural language processing models that can be used in applications like chatbots, document summarization, text-to-speech conversion, machine translation, and more. GPT technologies can also be used for text recognition and understanding for tasks such as text classification, text summarization and deep text understanding. GPT can also be used to develop natural language models that understand complex language structures, as well as extract relevant information from large bodies of text. Additionally, tasks such as information extraction, dialog systems, question answering and image caption generation can be implemented using GPT technologies.  This can help automate many tasks, allowing humans to save time and effort. By applying GPT to natural language processing, the possibilities are endless. \n11. Instruction: Identify the grammar errors in the following sentence.\n\n11. Input:\nAlice has not seen ent trustly  the movie yet.\n\n11. Output:\nThe sentence has two grammar errors.
