Another concern is the potential threat of technology replacing or displacing jobs. Many traditional, labor-intensive occupations are being replaced by automated machines and software, resulting in global unemployment. Finally, while the advancement of technology is often lauded as a way to combat climate change, if not regulated, unchecked technology growth can have significant environmental implications, such as increased pollution and energy consumption."}]
