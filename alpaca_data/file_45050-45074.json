Furthermore, post-production techniques such as CGI have enabled filmmakers to create more compelling visuals. \n\nFinally, the increasing prevalence of film festivals around the world has made it easier for independent filmmakers to gain exposure and to reach large audiences. This has created a domino effect, inspiring more filmmakers to pursue their creative vision and share it with the world."},{"instruction":"You are provided with a statement.

This system promotes equality and (in theory) prevents one leader from gaining total control over the people. It also allows citizens to directly influence the decisions of their government. \n\nIn a monarchy, a leader with inherited power, often a monarch or an emperor, has full control over the government. This leader's power is passed down from parent to child, and people have no input over the decisions of their government. \n\nIn an autocracy, any leader, such as a dictator, has full control and authority over the government. These governments are often led by a single individual or small group whose decisions are not reached democratically. This type of system allows one leader to make decisions without consulting the people they rule. \n\nUltimately, the main difference between the three government systems is the way in which those in power are chosen. Democracies are based on popular selection, monarchies are hereditary, and autocracies are ruled by a single individual or small group."},{"instruction":"Create an HTML page that displays a table with employee information.","input":"Name | Role | Salary \nJohn Smith | Manager | $70000\nAnna Jones | Developer | $50000\nMark Wilson | Designer | $55000","output":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\u003chead\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003e Employee Information \u003c/title\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003ctable\u003e\n        \u003cthead\u003e\n            \u003ctr\u003e\n                \u003cth\u003eName\u003c/th\u003e\n                \u003cth\u003eRole\u003c/th\u003e \n                \u003cth\u003eSalary\u003c/th\u003e \n            \u003c/tr\u003e\n        \u003c/thead\u003e\n        \u003ctbody\u003e\n            \u003ctr\u003e\n                \u003ctd\u003eJohn Smith\u003c/td\u003e \n                \u003ctd\u003eManager\u003c/td\u003e \n                \u003ctd\u003e$70000\u003c/td\u003e \n            \u003c/tr\u003e\n            \u003ctr\u003e\n                \u003ctd\u003eAnna Jones\u003c/td\u003e \n                \u003ctd\u003eDeveloper\u003c/td\u003e \n                \u003ctd\u003e$50000\u003c/td\u003e \n            \u003c/tr\u003e\n            \u003ctr\u003e\n                \u003ctd\u003eMark Wilson\u003c/td\u003e \n                \u003ctd\u003eDesigner\u003c/td\u003e \n                \u003ctd\u003e$55000\u003c/td\u003e \n            \u003c/tr\u003e\n        \u003c/tbody\u003e\n    \u003c/table\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e"},{"instruction":"Construct a web page using HTML and CSS and showcase a product.","input":"","output":"\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\n  \u003chead\u003e\n    \u003ctitle\u003eProduct Page\u003c/title\u003e\n    \u003cstyle\u003e\n      body {\n        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n      }\n      .product-page {\n        display: flex;\n        flex-direction: column;\n        align-items: center;\n      }\n      .product-image img {\n        width: 400px;\n        height: 400px;\n      }\n      .product-description {\n        text-align: center;\n        font-size: 1.4em;\n      }\n      .product-price {\n        font-weight: bold;\n        font-size: 1.6em;\n      }\n    \u003c/style\u003e\n  \u003c/head\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"product-page\"\u003e\n      \u003ch1\u003eProduct Name\u003c/h1\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"product-image\"\u003e\n        \u003cimg src=\"product.jpg\" alt=\"Product Image\"\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"product-description\"\u003e\n        Product description\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"product-price\"\u003e\n        $99.99\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e"},{"instruction":"Describe how artificial intelligence is transforming the education sector.","input":"","output":"Artificial intelligence is transforming the education sector by enabling personalization, automation, and streamlining processes.
