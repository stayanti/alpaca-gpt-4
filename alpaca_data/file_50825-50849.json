It is driven by the “survival of the fittest” principle, where those individuals with more desirable traits are more likely to reproduce and pass their genes onto the next generation, while those with less desirable traits perish. Over time, this leads to the development of new species which are better suited to the environment. Artificial selection, on the other hand, involves humans directly selecting which organisms are able to reproduce. Unlike natural selection, this is a conscious decision where humans selectively choose which organisms gain reproductive advantages. This is done in order to produce organisms with a desired trait or characteristic, such as larger fruits or better yields. Both natural and artificial selection are important processes that have allowed us to shape the world and its organisms as we know it."},{"instruction":"Rewrite a given sentence to avoid repetition of words","input":"Independence Day is a day to celebrate our nation's nation's independence.","output":"Independence Day is a day to commemorate our country's freedom."},{"instruction":"Name five technologies that are commonly used in web development.","input":"","output":"Five technologies commonly used in web development are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
