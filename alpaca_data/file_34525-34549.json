[{"instruction":"Describe the communication between two neurons.","input":"","output":"Communication between two neurons occurs when an electrical impulse, or action potential, is generated in the sending neuron and transmitted along the axon. The action potential travels to the synapse of the receiving neuron, which releases neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters bind to receptors in the post synaptic membrane, and the signal is sent along the dendrites of the receiving neuron and an electrical signal is generated. This continues along the dendrites until an action potential is generated and the signal is sent to the cell body, which processes the information."},{"instruction":"Assemble this cabinet following the instructions provided below.","input":"![Cabinet](https://i.etsystatic.com/11764299/r/il/b9a7e5/1463799956/il_fullxfull.1463799956_sg1v.jpg)","output":"Step 1: Assemble the side panels of the cabinet by sliding the slots of the panels together.\nStep 2: Insert the top and bottom panels into the slots of the sides.\nStep 3: Attach the back panel to the frame of the cabinet with screws or nails.\nStep 4: Secure the front panel to the frame of the cabinet using screws or nails.\nStep 5: Place the cabinet doors onto the hinges and attach them using screws.\nStep 6: Place the shelves into the slots of the cabinet and secure them with screws."},{"instruction":"Generate a sentence using the words 'ceiling', 'window', 'frost'","input":"","output":"The sky outside the window was filled with a beautiful white frost on the ceiling."},{"instruction":"Please provide a brief explanation of the differences between a deep learning algorithm and a traditional machine learning algorithm.","input":"","output":"Deep learning algorithms are a modern form of machine learning algorithms that use artificial neural networks to learn and make decisions.
