By studying the sound waves that the dolphins make, researchers were able to identify one type of signal as \"burst pulses\" which are brief, high-pitched vocalisations used for communication. The research also showed that the dolphins alter the sound waves to create \"symmetric mega-bubbles\" in the water which can reflect sounds to specific locations and even cause background noise to be muffled. This suggests that dolphins have a highly evolved communication system which allows them to effectively talk with each other despite the interference of background noise."},{"instruction":"Create an algorithm that can sort an array of numbers into ascending order.","input":"[5, 2, 8, 1, 4]","output":"\"\"\"\nAlgorithm to sort an array of numbers into ascending order\n\"\"\"\n\ndef sort_ascending(nums):\n    sorted_list = []\n    while nums:\n        lowest = nums[0]\n        for num in nums:\n            if num \u003c lowest:\n                lowest = num\n        sorted_list.append(lowest)\n        nums.remove(lowest)\n\n    return sorted_list\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unsorted = [5, 2, 8, 1, 4]\n    print(sort_ascending(unsorted)) #[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]"},{"instruction":"Use the K-nearest neighbors algorithm to classify data points.","input":"Data points: [[1,2],[2,4],[2,3],[3,5],[3,1],[5,5],[5,3],[6,1],[6,2],[6,4]]","output":"\"\"\"\nALgorithm to classify data points using K-nearest neighbors\n\"\"\"\n\ndef knn(data_points, k):\n    labels = []\n\n    for point in data_points:\n        distances = []\n        for other_point in data_points:\n            if point != other_point:\n                distances.append(((point[0] - other_point[0]) ** 2 + (point[1] - other_point[1]) ** 2) ** 0.5)\n        #sort the distances \n        sorted_distances = sorted(distances)\n        #find the k-nearest neighbours\n        k_nearest = sorted_distances[:k]\n        #determine label using majority vote \n        labels.append(majority_vote(k_nearest))\n        \n    return labels \n\ndef majority_vote(k_nearest):\n    #code to find majority vote\n    pass \n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    data_points = [[1,2],[2,4],[2,3],[3,5],[3,1],[5,5],[5,3],[6,1],[6,2],[6,4]]\n    k = 3\n    print(knn(data_points, k))"},{"instruction":"Generate a headline that confirms recent trends in e-commerce.","input":"","output":"Online Shopping Booms as People Prefer Convenience and Safety."},{"instruction":"Construct a Boolean expression to decide whether a number is divisible by 5.","input":"","output":"(num % 5) == 0"},{"instruction":"Calculate the total price of 3 items with prices of $2.50, $4.25 and $6.","input":"","output":"The total price of the 3 items is $12.75."},{"instruction":"Describe how renewable energy can be used to power homes.","input":"","output":"Renewable energy is a powerful and sustainable option for powering homes. It utilizes natural resources like sunshine, wind, and water to produce electricity and can be used in a variety of ways. Solar panels are the most widely used option for large-scale home energy solutions, and are capable of heating a home and producing electricity. Wind turbines can provide clean energy production and are increasingly used in residential areas. Hydroelectric energy utilizes the natural power of rivers to generate electricity and is popular in areas with ample water sources. Finally, geothermal energy also uses the heat from the Earth to generate energy and is becoming more and more popular in residential applications. Ultimately, renewable energy offers a clean and efficient way to bring power to homes."},{"instruction":"Name one thing that you could do to reduce your environmental footprint.","input":"","output":"One simple way to reduce your environmental footprint is to switch to energy-efficient solutions every time you buy or replace electronics and appliances.
