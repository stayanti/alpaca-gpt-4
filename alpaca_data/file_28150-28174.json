It’s a unique way to gain firsthand experience, explore a new culture, and meet new people. But an often overlooked benefit of international volunteering is the potential to create a lasting, global impact. \n\nFor many years, the idea of volunteering abroad has been associated with the cliché of idealistic, college-aged students trying to “make a difference” in developing countries. Although volunteering abroad can still mean working with a local community on important initiatives to improve people’s lives, there are now a variety of programs that allow people to pursue a variety of initiatives—medical, educational, environmental, and more—in subtler, often more successful ways. \n\nInternational volunteering projects are invaluable in developing countries where resources are limited and locals are using innovation to make a difference. Many volunteers are able to create sustainable projects with an emphasis on the community’s input, needs, and abilities. These projects allow for an influx of outside knowledge and expertise in a way that cannot be explained through traditional aid practices. \n\nIt’s often thought that volunteering abroad is too expensive or unsafe for anyone to participate. Websites such as Global Volunteers provide important resources for volunteers willing to work abroad, including information about destination safety, fundraising advice, and project tracking.\n\nAt the end of the day, international volunteerism provides incredible value to both the volunteers and the communities they serve. Volunteering abroad gives volunteers the opportunity to learn, help others, and explore a new culture in an incredibly hands-on way. Simultaneously, volunteer projects travel long distances, showing communities that people in other countries care about their situation, and providing access to valuable skills and resources."},{"instruction":"Write a story of a student's first day at a new school.","input":"","output":"Nina nervously made her way into the courtyard of her new school, her heart pounding in her chest as she caught sight of the other students.
