Subsequent to his series of well-publicized experiments, engineers were able to build on his findings and research methods on a course toward developing the world’s first manned aircraft.\n\nBorn in Anklam, Pomerania, Germany, on May 23, 1848, Lilienthal took great interest in the study of birds as a child and as a teenager. In 1870, he graduated from the Royal Technical Academy of Berlin, known today as Berlin University, with a degree in mechanical engineering. Upon graduation, he volunteered for military service during the Franco-Prussian War, which he completed in 1871.\n\nWhile studying in Berlin, Lilienthal began his first experiments with human flight. With his brother Gustav, he built his first wood glider in 1867. This model was unsuccessful, but he continued to build winged vehicles and persevere in his study of the structure of bird wings and the aerodynamics of bird flight.\n\nLilienthal worked in Berlin as an engineer from 1871 to 1883 while he devoted personal time to aviation research. He and his brother became members of the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain in 1873, and Lilienthal gave his first public lecture about the theory of bird flight that same year.  He continued to conduct experiments with artificial wings and the way that they responded to the force of air and wind. Meanwhile, he also began inventing and patenting devices in a variety of fields, including a mining machine and children’s building blocks. He would earn some 25 patents over the course of his career, four of which were aviation-related.","output":"Otto Lilienthal, an aviation pioneer born in Germany in 1848, built and flew unpowered gliders to demonstrate the concept of heavier-than-air flight.
