These factors led to aggression, alliances, and ultimately the war itself. \n\nThe effects of World War II were far-reaching. It was the deadliest conflict in history, with an estimated 70-85 million lives being lost. It caused an economic boom for the Allied (winning) countries, and a depression for the Axis (losing) countries. It also ushered in an era of nuclear weapons and the Cold War with its created tension between the East and West."},{"instruction":"Compose a haiku that reflects on nature.","input":"","output":"Soaring beauty in flight\nPeaceful rivers running free\nNature's endless might"},{"instruction":"Summarize the relevance of immigration in the US.","input":"","output":"Immigration has been an essential part of the growth and development of the United States since its founding.
