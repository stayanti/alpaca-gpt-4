It seeks to prioritize sustainable economic growth, environmental protection and human rights. This shows an understanding of what's needed to make sure a responsible global economy can function. \n\nWhether or not these policies can be implemented on a global scale remains to be seen, but this group of representatives is showing a refreshing grasp of the issues. They understand that all nations should have a say in forming global trade policies. This should make for a fairer and more equitable trading environment, where all countries benefit from vibrant and sustainable economies."}]
