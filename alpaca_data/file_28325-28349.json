[{"instruction":"Provide a plan to improve the environment of your local park.","input":"","output":"One possible plan to improve the environment of the local park would be to start a local community initiative to reduce the litter in and around the park. This could involve organizing clean-up days, providing educational resources about littering, and encouraging people to bring and use their own reusable items. Additionally, planting native plants and trees in the park would improve air quality, provide shade and habitat for local wildlife, and add beauty to the park. Finally, setting up public water fountains and pet waste bag stations to encourage attendance and responsible behavior from park visitors would go a long way toward protecting the local environment."},{"instruction":"Describe the difference between jargon and technical language.","input":"","output":"Jargon is everyday language used among a particular profession or group that is difficult for outsiders to understand. Technical language, on the other hand, is a precise language used to describe the concepts and processes in a particular field. It is usually structured, scientific, and precise in its terminology and explanations. Technical language is often used in particular industries, such as science or medicine, to explain and exchange information."},{"instruction":"Compare and contrast the features of a GPT model and a recurrent neural network.","input":"","output":"A GPT model is a type of language model that uses inputted data to create output based on statistical probability of words and phrases within a set of data. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network that is able to analyze data in sets or sequences. A GPT model uses its probabilistic understanding of language to generate new text from a combination of new input and previously seen text, while RNNs use a series of contextual elements to extract relevant features from a given data set. GPT models are used for tasks such as natural language processing, text completion, and machine translation, while RNNs are used for tasks such as speech recognition and natural language understanding."},{"instruction":"What are two technologies used to make autonomous vehicles?","input":"","output":"Two technologies used to make autonomous vehicles are sensors and artificial intelligence (AI).

Traditional programming is restrictive as it is limited to a predetermined set of outcomes based on conditions set by the programmer. However, GPT models are able to generate new outcomes based on the input it receives, removing the need for predefined programming logic. Additionally, GPT models understand natural language, giving it the ability to respond to more complex user queries instead of relying on rigid keyword-based programming."},{"instruction":"Modify the given code to print out the largest number in the list.","input":"nums = [3, 4, 9, 5]\n\n# Iterate over nums\nfor num in nums:\n        # Check if num is even\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n                # Print out num\n                print(num)","output":"nums = [3, 4, 9, 5]\n\n# Assign largest_num to -infinity\nlargest_num = -float('inf')\n\n# Iterate over nums\nfor num in nums:\n    # Check if num is larger than largest_num\n    if num \u003e largest_num:\n        # Assign num to largest_num\n        largest_num = num\n\n# Print out largest_num\nprint(largest_num)"},{"instruction":"Generate 4 random English words","input":"","output":"mastery, intuition, enclosure, gluttony"},{"instruction":"Compute the greatest common divisor of the numbers 24 and 18","input":"","output":"The greatest common divisor of 24 and 18 is 6."},{"instruction":"Create an invention that would be beneficial to society.","input":"","output":"I would invent a device, called the \"Energy Grid\", which utilizes renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and geothermal, to provide clean, affordable, reliable and sustainable electricity to every household and business.
