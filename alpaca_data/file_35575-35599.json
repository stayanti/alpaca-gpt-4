[{"instruction":"Create a mental model that explains how the internet works.","input":"","output":"The internet can be thought of as a giant interconnected network of computers, servers, and networks that communicate with each other. To access the internet, a user's device must be able to send and receive data via the internet by connecting to a local network. This can be done by either plugging in a physical connection into the device or connecting to a local Wi-Fi network. Then, the data travels between the user's device and the internet service provider, which is then routed to the correct destination by routers. Data is then sent back in a similar manner. This chain of events occurs in a matter of milliseconds, allowing us to access information almost instantaneously."},{"instruction":"Generate a poem about nature that has four stanzas.","input":"","output":"Verse 1: \nIn nature everything is alive, \nFrom the blooming flower's to the humming hive. \nOn its own accord the wind freely blows, \nBringing life and joy where ever it goes. \n\nVerse 2:\nFrom the highest peak to the lowest valley, \nNature can be found in every alley. \nFrom the deepest depth of the oceans floor,\nTo the tallest clouds that soar. \n\nVerse 3: \nNature provides us with hope and dreams,\nFills our lives with joy, laughter and streams. \nGives us shelter from the hot summer sun,\nAnd comfort in knowing it will all be done.\n\nVerse 4: \nNature is generous and never asks for a cost, \nIt's simply here for us to enjoy and not to be lost. \nSo let us appreciate and respect it's beauty and grace,\nAnd take care of it with love to keep it alive in this place."},{"instruction":"Generate a JavaScript code that takes in a user's age and returns the current year plus their age","input":"","output":"// declare current year \nconst currentYear = 2020; \n\n// declare age \nlet age = 20; \n\n// calculate year when user will be age + current year \nlet fullAge = currentYear + age;\n\n// print result \nconsole.log(fullAge); // Expect output: 2040"},{"instruction":"Generate two possible questions a customer might ask related to the product.","input":"","output":"What is the expected delivery time for this product?
