[{"instruction":"Generate an email to a friend, asking them to join you in taking an online course.","input":"Course Name: Introduction to Machine Learning","output":"Hey [Friend],\n\nI'm taking an amazing online course called \"Introduction to Machine Learning\". It's a great way to learn about machine learning and its various applications. I think it would be awesome if you joined me!\n\nThe course is taught by Professor Craig, who is an expert in the field and highly experienced in teaching beginners. He walks us through every concept and provides plenty of opportunities for asking questions if something is unclear. There are also interactive code exercises where I can apply the concepts I'm learning.\n\nWe can catch up with each other and study together through video calls. We can even try the course projects together – it will be fun!\n\nLet me know if you're interested in joining me.\n\nCheers,\n[Your Name]"},{"instruction":"Assume you are a web designer, create an HTML layout using CSS classes.","input":"","output":"\u003cdiv class=\"container\"\u003e\n  \u003cdiv class=\"row\"\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"col-md-6\"\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"main-content\"\u003e\n        \u003c!-- main content goes here --\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003cdiv class=\"col-md-6 sidebar-container\"\u003e\n      \u003cdiv class=\"sidebar-content\"\u003e\n        \u003c!-- sidebar content goes here --\u003e\n      \u003c/div\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n  \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"},{"instruction":"Describe the natural language processing tasks you can do with GPT-3.","input":"","output":"GPT-3 can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as: text generation, machine translation, text classification, question answering, summarization, genre detection, parsing, sentiment analysis, information extraction, entity recognition, and text clustering.

It allows two parties to communicate securely, even if they do not have prior knowledge of one another. This allows two strangers to securely exchange encrypted messages with guaranteed confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. \n\nPublic-key cryptography works by assigning a pair of cryptographic keys (called a public-key and a private-key) to a user. The public-key, as the name implies, is available to the public and can be used to encrypt data. The owner of the keys can then use the private-key to decrypt the data. This ensures that data can only be read by the intended recipient, even if intercepted by a third-party. \n\nThe security of public-key cryptography lies in the difficulty of deriving the private-key from the public-key. The public-key can easily be generated from a mathematical algorithm, while the private-key is derived as the result of an extremely long and complicated mathematical process. This significant difference in time and complexity makes it practically impossible for an attacker to obtain the private-key from the public-key, leaving the data secure.\n\nPublic-key cryptography has become an indispensable security tool for securely exchanging sensitive data. Every day, millions of users rely on public-key cryptography for online banking and secure communication, knowing that their data will remain private."},{"instruction":"Create a chart to describe the process of converting a sentence to a vector.","input":"","output":"![Vector Conversion Process Chart](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/euhjc1gijSw2DjFzahC7RLp8hGxbC7VuYaKWDf7VFx1lmhQ7yEI_CmVov8uLSP-Lm7mIb9ZKVmKnfELroIFIvV5dCHbseUbGo3qVPu-Lk-91ezRZ1X_jNXLsu6PcsjKBOgRJzRw)"},{"instruction":"Improve the given sentence in terms of grammar.","input":"She doesn't like them apples.","output":"She doesn't like those apples."},{"instruction":"Generate a list of the 10 most valuable companies worldwide.","input":"","output":"1.
