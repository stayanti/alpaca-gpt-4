# Alpaca GPT4
This repository contains a script to improve the Alpaca instruction set using GPT4 responses. The goal is to create updated instructions that will be used to train the Lora weights with an improved instruction set.

## Getting Started
To get started, follow these instructions:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the update_alpaca_instruction.py script.
Copy the instruction for GPT4.
The update_alpaca_instruction.py script will pick at random an Alpaca instruction file and generate updated instructions using GPT4 responses. The updated instructions will be stored in a separate file. The cleaned alpalca dataset has been spread over many smaller files to reduce merge conflicts.
