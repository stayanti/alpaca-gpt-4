    "input": "",
    "output": "Building a fire in a bush survival situation can be both a benefit and a risk. On the one hand, it can be used to provide warmth and light in cold, dark environments, and can be used to cook food and purify water. On the other hand, fire can create significant risks, including smoke inhalation, fire spread, and danger to wildlife and other people. Additionally, smoke may also be visible and lead to potential rescuers being able to spot the fire. Therefore, caution must be used when building a fire in the bush and any risks should be weighed against the benefits.",
